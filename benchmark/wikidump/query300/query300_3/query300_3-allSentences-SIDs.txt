0	the statistical concept In probability theory and statistics , median is described as the numerical value separating the higher half of a sample , a population , or a probability distribution , from the lower half . 
1	The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one . 
2	If there is an even number of observations , then there is no single middle value ; the median is then usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values .

4	Simon , Laura J " Descriptive statistics " Statistical Education Resource Kit Penn State Department of Statistics In a sample of data , or a finite population , there may be no member of the sample whose value is identical to the median ( in the case of an even sample size ) , and , if there is such a member , there may be more than one so that the median may not uniquely identify a sample member . 
5	Nonetheless , the value of the median is uniquely determined with the usual definition . 
6	A related concept , in which the outcome is forced to correspond to a member of the sample , is the medoid . 
7	At most , half the population have values less than the median , and , at most , half have values greater than the median . 
8	If both groups contain less than half the population , then some of the population is exactly equal to the median . 
9	For example , if a &nbsp;<&nbsp; b &nbsp;<&nbsp; c , then the median of the list { a ,&nbsp; b ,&nbsp; c } is b , and , if a &nbsp;<&nbsp; b &nbsp;<&nbsp; c &nbsp;<&nbsp; d , then the median of the list { a ,&nbsp; b ,&nbsp; c ,&nbsp; d } is the mean of b and c ; i .e 
10	. 
11	, it is ( b &nbsp;+&nbsp; c )/2 . 
12	The median can be used as a measure of location when a distribution is skewed , when end-values are not known , or when one requires reduced importance to be attached to outlier , e.g. 
13	, because they may be measurement errors . 
14	The median of some variable x is denoted either as tilde{x } or as mu_{ 1/2 }( x) , ! 
15	. 
16	When the median is used as a location parameter in descriptive statistics , there are several choices for a measure of variability : the range , the interquartile range , the mean absolute deviation , and the median absolute deviation . 
17	Since the median is the same as the second quartile , its calculation is illustrated in the article on quartile . 
18	For any probability distribution on the real line with cumulative distribution function &nbsp; F , regardless of whether it is any kind of continuous probability distribution , in particular an absolutely continuous distribution ( and therefore has a probability density function ) , or a discrete probability distribution , a median&nbsp; m satisfies the inequalities or in which a Lebesgue&ndash;Stieltjes integral is used . 
19	For an absolutely continuous probability distribution with probability density function ƒ , we have The medians of certain types of distributions can be easily calculated from their parameters : thumb300pxComparison ofmean_medianandmode ( statistics )modeof twolog-normal distributionswith differentskewness . 
20	The median is used primarily for skewed distributions , which it summarizes differently than the arithmetic mean . 
21	Consider the multiset { 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 14 } . 
22	The median is 2 in this case , as is the mode , and it might be seen as a better indication of central tendency than the arithmetic mean of 4 . 
23	Calculation of medians is a popular technique in summary statistics and summarizing statistical data , since it is simple to understand and easy to calculate , while also giving a measure that is more robust in the presence of outlier values than is the mean . 
24	A median is also a central point that minimizes the arithmetic mean of the absolute deviations . 
25	In the above example , the median value of 2 minimizes the arithmetic mean of the absolute deviations ( 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;0&nbsp;+&nbsp;0&nbsp;+&nbsp;0&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;12 )&nbsp;/&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.33 
26	; in contrast , the mean value of 4 minimizes the arithmetic mean of the squares ( 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;100 )&nbsp;/&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;20.33 
27	. 
28	In the language of statistics , a value of c that minimizes is a median of the probability distribution of the random variable &nbsp; X . 
29	However , a median c need not be uniquely defined . 
30	Where exactly one median exists , statisticians speak of " the median " correctly ; even when no unique median exists , some statisticians speak of " the median " informally . 
31	See also ''k ''-medians clustering . 
32	For continuous probability distributions , the difference between the median and the mean is never more than one standard deviation . 
33	See an inequality on location and scale parameters . 
34	Even though sorting n items requires ''O '' ( n &nbsp;log&nbsp; n ) operations , selection algorithm can compute the ''k ''th-smallest of ''n '' items ( e .g. 
35	, the median ) with only O ( n ) operations . 
36	" When I was working on the MEDIAN problem , my goal was to prove that any deterministic algorithm to find the MEDIAN of n integers must necessarily make roughly as many comparisons as it takes to sort n integers , i .e 
37	. 
38	, n log n comparisons . 
39	I was shocked to discover that the median of n integers can be found with just O( n ) comparisons . 
40	" -- Manuel Blum , As an example , we will calculate the sample median for the following set of observations : 1 , 5 , 2 , 8 , 7. 
41	Start by sorting the values : 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 8. 
42	In this case , the median is 5 since it is the middle observation in the ordered list . 
43	The median is the ( ( n &nbsp;+&nbsp;1 )/2 )th item , where n is the number of values . 
44	For example , for the list {1 ,&nbsp;2 ,&nbsp;5 ,&nbsp;7 ,&nbsp;8} , we have n &nbsp;=&nbsp;5 , so the median is the ( (5&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 )/2 )th item . 
45	As an example , we will calculate the sample median for the following set of observations : 1 , 6 , 2 , 8 , 7 , 2. 
46	Start by sorting the values : 1 , 2 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 8. 
47	In this case , the arithmetic mean of the two middlemost terms is ( 2 + 6)/2 = 4 . 
48	Therefore , the median is 4 since it is the arithmetic mean of the middle observations in the ordered list . 
49	We also use this formula MEDIAN = {( n+1 )/2 } th item . 
50	n= Number of values As above example 1 , 2 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 8n=6 Median ={( 6+1 )/2}th item =3.5 
51	th item If data are represented by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distribution , then estimates of the median can be obtained by fitting that family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution . 
52	See , for example Pareto interpolation . 
53	Any ' 'mean ''-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk ( expected loss ) with respect to the squared-error loss function , as observed by Gauss . 
54	A ' 'median ''-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk with respect to the absolute-deviation loss function , as observed by Laplace . 
55	Other loss functions are used in statistical theory , particularly in robust statistics . 
56	The theory of median-unbiased estimators was revived by in 1947 : An estimate of a one-dimensional parameter θ will be said to be median-unbiased , if , for fixed θ , the median of the distribution of the estimate is at the value θ ; i .e 
57	. 
58	, the estimate underestimates just as often as it overestimates . 
59	This requirement seems for most purposes to accomplish as much as the mean-unbiased requirement and has the additional property that it is invariant under one-to-one transformation . 
60	[page 584] Further properties of median-unbiased estimators have been noted by Lehmann_ Birnbaum , van der Vaart and Pfanzagl . 
61	In particular , median-unbiased estimators exist in cases where mean-unbiased and maximum-likelihood estimators do not exist . 
62	Besides being invariant under one-to-one transformations , median-unbiased estimators have surprising robustness . 
63	Median filter In monochrome raster image there is a type of noise , known as the salt and pepper noise , when each pixel independently becomes black ( with some small probability ) or white ( with some small probability ) , and is unchanged otherwise ( with the probability close to 1 ).An 
64	image constructed of median values of neighborhoods ( like 3×3 square ) can effectively reduce noise in this case . 
65	Gustav Fechner popularized the median into the formal analysis of data , although it had been used previously by Laplace .
