4	For example , the geometric mean can give a meaningful "average " to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability , and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability .

4	"the geometric mean"	"can give"	"4 For example a meaningful average to compare two companies which each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability"

4	"their"	"has"	"environmental sustainability"	
4	"their"	"has"	"financial viability"	
5	If an arithmetic mean was used instead of a geometric mean , the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating ( e .g 
6	. 
7	going from 80 to 90 ) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability ( e .g 
8	. 
9	going from 2 to 5 ) . 
9	"9"	"going"	"from 2 to 5"	
10	The use of a geometric mean "normalizes " the ranges being averaged , so that no range dominates the weighting , and a given percentage change in any of the properties has the same effect on the geometric mean .
