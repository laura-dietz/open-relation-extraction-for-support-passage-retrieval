If an arithmetic mean was used instead of a geometric mean , the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating ( e .g 	5	query300_Geometric_mean\S\5
. 	6	query300_Geometric_mean\S\6
going from 80 to 90 ) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability ( e .g 	7	query300_Geometric_mean\S\7
