5	Standard deviation is a widely used measure of variability or diversity used in statistics and probability theory . 
6	It shows how much variation or " dispersion " exists from the average ( mean , or expected value ) . 
7	A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean , whereas high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values . 
8	The standard deviation of a statistical population , data set , or probability distribution is the square root of its variance . 
9	It is algebra simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation .

11	In addition to expressing the variability of a population , standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions . 
12	For example , the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times . 
13	The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­ – the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval . 
14	In science , researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data , and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation . 
15	Standard deviation is also important in finance , where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment . 
16	When only a sample of data from a population is available , the population standard deviation can be estimated by a modified quantity called the sample standard deviation , explained below . 
17	Consider a population consisting of the following eight values : These eight data points have the mean (average ) of 5 : To calculate the population standard deviation , first compute the difference of each data point from the mean , and square the result of each : Next compute the average of these values , and take the square root : This quantity is the population standard deviation ; it is equal to the square root of the variance . 
18	The formula is valid only if the eight values we began with form the complete population . 
19	If they instead were a random sample , drawn from some larger , "parent " population , then we should have used 7&nbsp;( which is n − 1 ) instead of 8&nbsp;( which is n ) in the denominator of the last formula , and then the quantity thus obtained would have been called the sample standard deviation . 
20	See the section Estimation below for more details . 
21	A slightly more complicated real life example , the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70" , with a standard deviation of around 3" . 
22	This means that most men ( about 68 % , assuming a normal distribution ) have a height within 3" of the mean ( 67"–73" ) — one standard deviation — and almost all men ( about 95 % ) have a height within 6 " of the mean ( 64"–76" ) — two standard deviations . 
23	If the standard deviation were zero , then all men would be exactly 70 " tall . 
24	If the standard deviation were 20" , then men would have much more variable heights , with a typical range of about 50"–90" . 
25	Three standard deviations account for 99.7 
26	% of the sample population being studied , assuming the distribution is normal ( bell-shaped ) . 
27	Let X be a random variable with mean value μ : Here the operator E denotes the average or expected value of X . 
28	Then the standard deviation of X is the quantity That is , the standard deviation σ ( sigma ) is the square root of the variance of X , i .e 
29	. 
30	, it is the square root of the average value of ( X &nbsp;−&nbsp; μ ) 2 . 
31	The standard deviation of a ( univariate ) probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that distribution . 
32	Not all random variables have a standard deviation , since these expected values need not exist . 
33	For example , the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a Cauchy distribution is undefined because its expected value μ is undefined . 
34	In the case where X takes random values from a finite data set x 1 , x 2 , … , x N , with each value having the same probability , the standard deviation is or , using summation notation , If , instead of having equal probabilities , the values have different probabilities , let x 1 have probability p 1 , x 2 have probability p 2 , ... 
35	, x N have probability p N . 
36	In this case , the standard deviation will be The standard deviation of a continuous real-valued random variable X with probability density function p ( x ) is and where the integrals are definite integral taken for x ranging over the set of possible values of the random variable&nbsp; X . 
37	In the case of a parametric family of distributions , the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the parameters . 
38	For example , in the case of the log-normal distribution with parameters μ and σ 2 , the standard deviation is [( exp( σ 2 )&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 )exp( 2 μ &nbsp;+&nbsp; σ 2 ) ] 1/2 . 
39	One can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases ( such as standardized testing ) where every member of a population is sampled . 
40	In cases where that cannot be done , the standard deviation σ is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population . 
41	Some estimators are given below : An estimator for σ sometimes used is the standard deviation of the sample , denoted by s N and defined as follows : This estimator has a uniformly smaller mean squared error than the sample standard deviation ( see below ) , and is the maximum-likelihood estimate when the population is normally distributed January 2012 . 
42	But this estimator , when applied to a small or moderately sized sample , tends to be too low : it is a biased estimator . 
43	The standard deviation of the sample is the same as the population standard deviation of a discrete random variable that can assume precisely the values from the data set , where the probability for each value is proportional to its multiplicity in the data set . 
44	The most common estimator for σ used is an adjusted version , the sample standard deviation , denoted by s and defined as follows : where scriptstyle{ x_1 ,,x_2 ,,ldots , ,x_N} are the observed values of the sample items and scriptstyleoverline{x } is the mean value of these observations . 
45	This correction ( the use of N &nbsp;−&nbsp;1 instead of&nbsp; N ) is known as Bessel 's correction . 
46	The reason for this correction is that s 2 is an unbiased estimator for the variance σ 2 of the underlying population , if that variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement . 
47	However , s is not an unbiased estimator for the standard deviation σ ; it tends to overestimate the population standard deviation . 
48	The term standard deviation of the sample is used for the uncorrected estimator (using N ) while the term sample standard deviation is used for the corrected estimator (using N &nbsp;−&nbsp;1 ) . 
49	The denominator N &nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is the number of degrees of freedom in the vector of residuals , scriptstyle( x_1-overline{x} , ; dots , ; x_n-overline{x} ) . 
50	Unbiased estimation of standard deviation Bias of an estimator Although an unbiased estimator for σ is known when the random variable is normally distributed , the formula is complicated and amounts to a minor correction . 
51	Moreover , unbiasedness ( in this sense of the word ) is not always desirable . 
52	September 2010 The standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate . 
53	This is especially true if the number of samples is very low . 
54	This effect can be described by the confidence interval or CI.For 
55	example for N=2 the 95 % CI of the SD is from 0.45*SD 
56	to 31.9*SD. 
57	In other words the standard deviation of the distribution in 95 % of the cases can be up to a factor of 31 larger or up to a factor 2 smaller ! 
58	For N=10 the interval is 0.69*SD 
59	to 1.83*SD 
60	, the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD. 
61	For N=100 this is down to 0.88*SD 
62	to 1.16*SD. 
63	So to be sure the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points . 
64	The standard deviation is invariant under changes in location , and scales directly with the scale of the random variable . 
65	Thus , for a constant c and random variables X and Y : The standard deviation of the sum of two random variables can be related to their individual standard deviations and the covariance between them : where scriptstyleoperatorname{var } ,= , operatorname{stdev}^2 and scriptstyleoperatorname{cov} stand for variance and covariance , respectively . 
66	The calculation of the sum of squared deviations can be related to moment calculated directly from the data . 
67	The standard deviation of the sample can be computed as : The sample standard deviation can be computed as : For a finite population with equal probabilities at all points , we have Thus , the standard deviation is equal to the square root of ( the average of the squares less the square of the average ).See 
68	computational formula for the variance for a proof of this fact , and for an analogous result for the sample standard deviation . 
69	A large standard deviation indicates that the data points are far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean . 
70	For example , each of the three populations {0 , 0, 14 , 14} , {0 , 6 , 8 , 14} and {6 , 6 , 8 , 8} has a mean of 7. 
71	Their standard deviations are 7 , 5 , and 1 , respectively . 
72	The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7. 
73	In a loose sense , the standard deviation tells us how far from the mean the data points tend to be . 
74	It will have the same units as the data points themselves . 
75	If , for instance , the data set {0 , 6 , 8 , 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years , the standard deviation is 5 years . 
76	As another example , the population {1000 , 1006 , 1008 , 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes , measured in meters . 
77	It has a mean of 1007 meters , and a standard deviation of 5 meters . 
78	Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty . 
79	In physical science , for example , the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated measurement should give the precision of those measurements . 
80	When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction , the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance : if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction ( with the distance measured in standard deviations ) , then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised . 
81	This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified . 
82	See prediction interval . 
83	The practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the "average " ( mean ) . 
84	As a simple example , consider the average daily maximum temperatures for two cities , one inland and one on the coast . 
85	It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland . 
86	Thus , while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature , the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as , on any particular day , the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one . 
87	Another way of seeing it is to consider sports teams . 
88	In any set of categories , there will be teams that rate highly at some things and poorly at others . 
89	Chances are , the teams that lead in the standings will not show such disparity but will perform well in most categories . 
90	The lower the standard deviation of their ratings in each category , the more balanced and consistent they will tend to be . 
91	Teams with a higher standard deviation , however , will be more unpredictable . 
92	For example , a team that is consistently bad in most categories will have a low standard deviation . 
93	A team that is consistently good in most categories will also have a low standard deviation . 
94	However , a team with a high standard deviation might be the type of team that scores a lot ( strong offense ) but also concedes a lot ( weak defense ) , or , vice versa , that might have a poor offense but compensates by being difficult to score on . 
95	Trying to predict which teams , on any given day , will win , may include looking at the standard deviations of the various team " stats " ratings , in which anomalies can match strengths vs. 
96	weaknesses to attempt to understand what factors may prevail as stronger indicators of eventual scoring outcomes . 
97	In racing , a driver is timed on successive laps . 
98	A driver with a low standard deviation of lap times is more consistent than a driver with a higher standard deviation . 
99	This information can be used to help understand where opportunities might be found to reduce lap times . 
100	In finance , standard deviation is a representation of the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset ( stocks , bonds , property , etc. 
101	) , or the risk of a portfolio of assets http ://www.edupristine

105	What is Standard Deviation Pristine 2011-10-29 ( actively managed mutual funds , index mutual funds , or ETFs ) . 
106	Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions ( known as mean-variance optimization ) . 
107	The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases , the expected return on an investment should increase as well , an increase known as the "risk premium . 
108	" In other words , investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty . 
109	When evaluating investments , investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns . 
110	Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns . 
111	For example , let 's assume an investor had to choose between two stocks . 
112	Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent , with a standard deviation of 20 percentage point ( pp ) and Stock B , over the same period , had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp . 
113	On the basis of risk and return , an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice , because Stock B 's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation ( greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return ) . 
114	Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment ( but also to exceed the initial investment ) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances , and is estimated to return only two percent more on average . 
115	In this example , Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent , plus or minus 20 pp ( a range of 30 percent to -10 percent ) , about two-thirds of the future year returns . 
116	When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future , an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp , or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent , which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return ( about 99.7 
117	percent of probable returns ) . 
118	Calculating the average ( or arithmetic mean ) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset . 
119	For each period , subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean . 
120	Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset . 
121	The larger the variance , the greater risk the security carries . 
122	Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question . 
123	Population standard deviation is used to set the width of Bollinger Bands , a widely adopted technical analysis tool . 
124	For example , the upper Bollinger Band is given as } }"text-decoration :overline ; " > x </span> + nσ x . 
125	The most commonly used value for n is 2 ; there is about a five percent chance of going outside , assuming a normal distribution of returns . 
126	To gain some geometric insights and clarification , we will start with a population of three values , x 1 , x 2 , x 3 . 
127	This defines a point P = ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) in R 3 . 
128	Consider the line L = { ( r , r , r ) : r ∈ R } . 
129	This is the "main diagonal " going through the origin . 
130	If our three given values were all equal , then the standard deviation would be zero and P would lie on L . 
131	So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the distance of P to L . 
132	And that is indeed the case . 
133	To move orthogonally from L to the point P , one begins at the point : whose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with . 
134	A little algebra shows that the distance between P and M ( which is the same as the orthogonal distance between P and the line L ) is equal to the standard deviation of the vector x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , multiplied by the square root of the number of dimensions of the vector ( 3 in this case . 
135	) Chebyshev 's inequality An observation is rarely more than a few standard deviations away from the mean . 
136	Chebyshev 's inequality ensures that , for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined , the amount of data within a number of standard deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table . 
137	thumb350pxDark blue is less than one standard deviation from the mean . 
138	For the normal distribution _ this accounts for 68.27 
139	percent of the set ; while two standard deviations from the mean ( medium and dark blue ) account for 95.45 
140	percent ; three standard deviations ( light _ medium_ and dark blue ) account for 99.73 
141	percent ; and four standard deviations account for 99.994 
142	percent . 
143	The two points of the curve that are one standard deviation from the mean are also theinflection points . 
144	The central limit theorem says that the distribution of an average of many independent , identically distributed random variables tends toward the famous bell-shaped normal distribution with a probability density function of : where μ is the expected value of the random variables , &sigma ; equals their distribution 's standard deviation divided by n 1/2 , and n is the number of random variables . 
145	The standard deviation therefore is simply a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the curve will be , though it also appears in the normalizing constant . 
146	If a data distribution is approximately normal then the proportion of data values within z standard deviations of the mean is defined by : where scriptstyleoperatorname{erf } is the error function . 
147	If a data distribution is approximately normal then about 68 percent of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean ( mathematically , μ&nbsp;±&nbsp;σ , where μ is the arithmetic mean ) , about 95 percent are within two standard deviations ( μ&nbsp;±&nbsp;2σ ) , and about 99.7 
148	percent lie within three standard deviations ( μ&nbsp;±&nbsp;3σ ) . 
149	This is known as the 68-95-99.7 
150	rule , or the empirical rule . 
151	For various values of z , the percentage of values expected to lie in and outside the symmetric interval , CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;( − z σ ,&nbsp; z σ ) , are as follows : Table The mean and the standard deviation of a set of data are usually reported together . 
152	In a certain sense , the standard deviation is a "natural " measure of statistical dispersion if the center of the data is measured about the mean . 
153	This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point . 
154	The precise statement is the following : suppose x 1 , ... 
155	, x n are real numbers and define the function : Using calculus or by completing the square , it is possible to show that σ ( r ) has a unique minimum at the mean : Variability can also be measured by the coefficient of variation , which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean . 
156	It is a dimensionless number . 
157	Often we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained . 
158	We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean.The 
159	standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by : where N is the number of observation in the sample used to estimate the mean . 
160	This can easily be proven with : hence Resulting in : Algorithms for calculating variance The following two formulas can represent a running ( continuous ) standard deviation . 
161	A set of three power sums s 0 , s 1 , s 2 are each computed over a set of N values of x , denoted as x 1 , ... 
162	, x N : Note that s 0 raises x to the zero power , and since x 0 is always 1 , s 0 evaluates to N . 
163	Given the results of these three running summations , the values s 0 , s 1 , s 2 can be used at any time to compute the current value of the running standard deviation : Similarly for sample standard deviation , In a computer implementation , as the three s j sums become large , we need to consider round-off error , arithmetic overflow , and arithmetic underflow . 
164	The method below calculates the running sums method with reduced rounding errors .

176	Sample variance : Standard variance : When the values x i are weighted with unequal weights w i , the power sums s 0 , s 1 , s 2 are each computed as : And the standard deviation equations remain unchanged . 
177	Note that s 0 is now the sum of the weights and not the number of samples N . 
178	The incremental method with reduced rounding errors can also be applied , with some additional complexity . 
179	A running sum of weights must be computed for each k from 1 to n : and places where 1/ n is used above must be replaced by w i / W n : In the final division , and where n is the total number of elements , and n' is the number of elements with non-zero weights.The 
180	above formulas become equal to the simpler formulas given above if weights are taken as equal to one . 
181	June 2011 The populations of sets , which may overlap , can be calculated simply as follows : Standard deviations of non-overlapping ( } } ∅ ) sub-populations can be aggregated as follows if the size ( actual or relative to one another ) and means of each are known : For example , suppose it is known that the average American man has a mean height of 70&nbsp;inches with a standard deviation of three inches and that the average American woman has a mean height of 65&nbsp;inches with a standard deviation of two inches . 
182	Also assume that the number of men , N , is equal to the number of women . 
183	Then the mean and standard deviation of heights of American adults could be calculated as : For the more general case of M non-overlapping populations , X 1 through X M , and the aggregate population scriptstyle X ,= , bigcup_i X_i : where If the size ( actual or relative to one another ) , mean , and standard deviation of two overlapping populations are known for the populations as well as their intersection , then the standard deviation of the overall population can still be calculated as follows : If two or more sets of data are being added together datapoint by datapoint , the standard deviation of the result can be calculated if the standard deviation of each data set and the covariance between each pair of data sets is known : For the special case where no correlation exists between any pair of data sets , then the relation reduces to the root-mean-square : Standard deviations of non-overlapping ( } } ∅ ) sub-samples can be aggregated as follows if the actual size and means of each are known : For the more general case of M non-overlapping data sets , X 1 through X M , and the aggregate data set scriptstyle X ,= , bigcup_i X_i : where : If the size , mean , and standard deviation of two overlapping samples are known for the samples as well as their intersection , then the standard deviation of the aggregated sample can still be calculated .
