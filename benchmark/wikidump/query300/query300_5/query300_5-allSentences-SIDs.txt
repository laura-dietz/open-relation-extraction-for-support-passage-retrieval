4	Microsoft Excel is a proprietary commercial spreadsheet application written and distributed by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X . 
5	It features calculation , graphing tools , pivot table , and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications . 
6	It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms , especially since version 5 in 1993 , and it has almost completely replaced Lotus 1-2-3 as the industry standard for spreadsheets . 
7	Excel forms part of Microsoft Office . 
8	The current versions are 2010 for Microsoft Windows and 2011 for Mac OS X .

102	?id=2IBbPiP3wOIC&pg=PA79 Chapter 6 : Using the Excel macro recorder 79 ff Revised by Jan Karel Pieterse 0470046740 2007 Wiley The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro . 
103	These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro . 
104	The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts , a command button or a graphic . 
105	The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options . 
106	The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. 
107	Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompts by their own properties , and some graphical display items , cannot be recorded , but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer . 
108	Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program , or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed .

117	User -created VBA subroutine execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder , but are more flexible and efficient . 
118	Excel supports chart , graphs or histogram generated from specified groups of cells . 
119	The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet , or added as a separate object . 
120	These displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells change . 
121	For example , suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually ; then , in response to a user 's change in trial values for parameters , the curves describing the design change shape , and their points of intersection shift , assisting the selection of the best design .

127	OLE Object Linking and Embedding : allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data . 
128	This may take on the form of "embedding " where an application uses another to handle as task that it is more suited to , for example a Powerpoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa .

209	Heiser 2008 2010-04-08 as mishandling missing data , as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round-off and large numbers , as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed , and as having a limited set of statistical tools . 
210	Microsoft has announced some of these issues are addressed in Excel 2010 . 
211	Comments are provided from readers that may illuminate some remaining problems . 
212	In the Microsoft Excel 2007 , menus related to graphs and graph formatting have been changed . 
213	Some common activities in using graphs are less transparent than previously . 
214	For example , to add a curve to a graph , one can right click on the graph and choose " select data " from the drop-down menu , or use the " chart tools/design " tab . 
215	However , when there are other drop-down menus open , this menu does n't appear and the " select data " option is grayed out (unavailable ) from the toolbar . 
216	That facet of the menu system must be "discovered " by the user . 
217	Excel has issues with modulo operation .

245	Microsoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error : The reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells . 
246	If there is a cell = '[ Book1.xlsx]Sheet1' 
247	!$ 
248	G$ 33 , and there are two books named " Book1 " open , there is no way to tell which one the user means . 
249	Numeric precision in Microsoft Excel thumb390pxExcel maintains 15 figures in its numbers _ but they are not always accurate : the bottom line should be the same as the top line . 
250	Despite the use of 15-figure precision , Excel can display many more figures (up to thirty ) upon user request . 
251	But the displayed figures are not those actually used in its computations , and so , for example , the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values . 
252	Although such departures are usually beyond the 15th decimal , exceptions do occur , especially for very large or very small numbers . 
253	Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers ( for example , using the Excel If function ) , as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable . 
254	In the figure the fraction 1/9000 is displayed in Excel . 
255	Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones , Excel displays only the leading 15 figures . 
256	In the second line , the number one is added to the fraction , and again Excel displays only 15 figures . 
257	In the third line , one is subtracted from the sum using Excel . 
258	Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1 's after the decimal , the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0 's followed by a string of eleven 1 's . 
259	However , the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0 's followed by a string of thirteen 1 's and two extra erroneous digits . 
260	Thus , the numbers Excel calculates with to obtain the third line are not the numbers that it displays in the first two lines . 
261	Moreover , the error in Excel 's answer is not just round-off error . 
262	Excel works with a modified 1985 version of the IEEE 754 specification .

267	; article ID : 78113 June 30 , 2010 2010-07-02 Excel 's implementation involves an amalgam of truncations and conversions between binary and decimal representations , leading to accuracy that sometimes is better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision , and sometimes much worse . 
268	See the main article for details . 
269	Besides accuracy in user computations , the question of accuracy in Excel -provided functions may be raised . 
270	Particularly in the arena of statistical functions , Excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation .

282	?id=dtSdrjjVXrwC&pg=PA198 Microsoft originally marketed a spreadsheet program called Multiplan in 1982 . 
283	Multiplan became very popular on CP/M systems , but on MS-DOS systems it lost popularity to Lotus 1-2-3 . 
284	Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac in 30 September 1985 , and the first Windows version ( numbered 2.05 
285	to line up with the Mac and bundled with a run-time Windows environment ) in November 1987 .

291	This accomplishment , dethroning the king of the software world , solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future of developing GUI software . 
292	Microsoft pushed its advantage with regular new releases , every two years or so . 
293	Early in 1993 Excel became the target of a trademark lawsuit by another company already selling a software package named " Excel " in the finance industry . 
294	As the result of the dispute Microsoft had to refer to the program as " Microsoft Excel " in all of its formal press releases and legal documents . 
295	However , over time this practice has been ignored , and Microsoft cleared up the issue permanently when they purchased the trademark of the other program . 
296	October 2008 Microsoft also encouraged the use of the letters XL as shorthand for the program ; while this is no longer common , the program 's icon on Windows still consists of a stylized combination of the two letters , and the file extension of the default Excel format is .xls 
297	. 
298	Excel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets ; however , the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software , VisiCalc : the program displays cells organized in rows and columns , and each cell may contain data or a formula , with relative or absolute references to other cells . 
299	Excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets ( fonts , character attributes and cell appearance ) . 
300	It also introduced intelligent cell recomputation , where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated ( previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command ) . 
301	Excel has extensive graphing capabilities , and enables users to perform mail merge . 
302	With version 5.0 
303	( 1993 ) , Excel has included Visual Basic for Applications ( VBA ) , a programming language based on Visual Basic which adds the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user-defined functions ( UDF) for use in worksheets . 
304	VBA is a powerful addition to the application and includes a fully featured integrated development environment ( IDE ) . 
305	Macro recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions , thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks . 
306	VBA allows the creation of forms and in-worksheet controls to communicate with the user . 
307	The language supports use ( but not creation ) of ActiveX ( COM ) DLL 's ; later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic object-oriented programming techniques . 
308	The automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for macro viruses . 
309	This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses . 
310	Microsoft belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely , to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate . 
311	Versions 5.0 
312	to 9.0 
313	of Excel contain various Easter eggs , including a Hall of Tortured Souls , although since version 10 Microsoft has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products .

316	Why no Easter Eggs ? Larry Osterman October 21 , 2005 2006-07-29 Larry Osterman 's WebLog MSDN Blogs Microsoft Office 2000 For many users , one of the most obvious changes introduced with Excel 2000 ( and the rest of the Office 2000 suite ) involved a clipboard that could hold multiple objects at once . 
317	In another noticeable change the Office Assistant , whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel 97 had annoyed many users , became less intrusive . 
318	64pxthumbExcel 2007 icon thumb250pxMicrosoft Excel 2007 The most obvious change is a completely revamped user interface called the Ribbon menu system , which means a user must abandon most habits acquired from previous versions . 
319	Some practical advantages of the new system are a decreased number of mouse-clicks needed to reach a given functionality ( e .g 
320	. 
321	removing the gridlines now takes 2 mouse-clicks instead of 5 ) , greatly improved management of named variables through the Name Manager , and much improved flexibility in formatting graphs , which now allow ( x , y ) coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight . 
322	The number of rows is now 1,048,576 and columns is 16,384 . 
323	Several improvements to pivot tables were introduced . 
324	Office Open XML file formats were introduced , including .xlsm 
325	for a workbook with macros and .xlsx 
326	for a workbook without macros .
