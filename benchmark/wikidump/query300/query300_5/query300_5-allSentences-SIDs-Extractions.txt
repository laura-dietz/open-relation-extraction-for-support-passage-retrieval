257	"one"	"is subtracted"	"using Excel 257 In the third line"	
258	Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1 's after the decimal , the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0 's followed by a string of eleven 1 's .

259	However , the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0 's followed by a string of thirteen 1 's and two extra erroneous digits . 
259	"the difference is three 0 's followed by a string of thirteen 1 's"	"be reported"	"by Excel in the third line"	
259	"the difference is three 0 's followed by a string of thirteen 's two extra erroneous digits"	"be reported"	"by Excel in the third line"

259	"three 0 's"	"be followed"	"by a string of thirteen 's two extra erroneous digits"	
260	Thus , the numbers Excel calculates with to obtain the third line are not the numbers that it displays in the first two lines .
