0	In mathematics , the harmonic mean ( sometimes called the subcontrary mean ) is one of several kinds of average . 
1	Typically , it is appropriate for situations when the average of rate is desired . 
2	The harmonic mean H of the positive real number x 1 ,&nbsp; x 2 ,&nbsp;... 
3	,&nbsp; x n &nbsp;>&nbsp;0 is defined to be From the third formula in the above equation it is more apparent that the harmonic mean is related to the arithmetic mean and geometric mean . 
4	Equivalently , the harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals . 
5	As a simple example , the harmonic mean of 1 , 2 , and 4 is frac{3}{frac{1}{ 1}+frac{1}{ 2}+frac{1}{ 4} } = frac{1}{frac{1}{ 3}( frac{1}{ 1}+frac{1}{ 2}+frac{1}{ 4} ) } = frac{12}{ 7} , .

7	Harmonic mean is denoted by '' H '' in purple color . 
8	The '' Q '' denotes a fourth mean_ thequadratic mean . 
9	The harmonic mean is one of the three Pythagorean means . 
10	For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of nonequal values , the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means , while the arithmetic mean is always the greatest of the three and the geometric mean is always in between . 
11	( If all values in a nonempty dataset are equal , the three means are always equal to one another ; e.g 
12	. 
13	the harmonic , geometric , and arithmetic means of {2 ,&nbsp;2 ,&nbsp;2 } are all&nbsp;2 . 
14	) It is the special case M &minus ;1 of the power mean . 
15	Since the harmonic mean of a list of numbers tends strongly toward the least elements of the list , it tends ( compared to the arithmetic mean ) to mitigate the impact of large outliers and aggravate the impact of small ones . 
16	The arithmetic mean is often mistakenly used in places calling for the harmonic mean . 
17	Statistical Analysis , Ya-lun Chou , Holt International , 1969 , ISBN 0030730953 In the speed example below for instance the arithmetic mean 50 is incorrect , and too big . 
18	The harmonic mean is related to the other Pythagorean means , as seen in the third formula in the above equation . 
19	This is noticed if we interpret the denominator to be the arithmetic mean of the product of numbers n times but each time we omit the j th term . 
20	That is , for the first term we multiply all n numbers but omit the first , for the second we multiply all n numbers but omit the second and so on . 
21	The numerator , excluding the n , which goes with the arithmetic mean , is the geometric mean to the power&nbsp; n . 
22	Thus the n th harmonic mean is related to the n th geometric and arithmetic means . 
23	If a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a mean-preserving spread — that is , two or more elements of the set are " spread apart " from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged — then the harmonic mean always decreases .

26	If a set of weights w_1 , ... 
27	, w_n is associated to the dataset x_1 , ... 
28	, x_n , the weighted harmonic mean is defined by The harmonic mean as defined is the special case where all of the weights are equal to 1 , and is equivalent to any weighted harmonic mean where all weights are equal In certain situations , especially many situations involving rate and ratio , the harmonic mean provides the truest average . 
29	For instance , if a vehicle travels a certain distance at a speed x ( e .g 
30	. 
31	60 kilometres per hour ) and then the same distance again at a speed y ( e .g 
32	. 
33	40 kilometres per hour ) , then its average speed is the harmonic mean of x and y ( 48 kilometres per hour ) , and its total travel time is the same as if it had traveled the whole distance at that average speed . 
34	However , if the vehicle travels for a certain amount of time at a speed x and then the same amount of time at a speed y , then its average speed is the arithmetic mean of x and y , which in the above example is 50 kilometres per hour . 
35	The same principle applies to more than two segments : given a series of sub-trips at different speeds , if each sub-trip covers the same distance , then the average speed is the harmonic mean of all the sub-trip speeds , and if each sub-trip takes the same amount of time , then the average speed is the arithmetic mean of all the sub-trip speeds . 
36	( If neither is the case , then a weighted harmonic mean or weighted arithmetic mean is needed . 
37	) Similarly , if one connects two electrical resistor in parallel , one having resistance x ( e .g 
38	. 
39	60 Ω ) and one having resistance y ( e .g 
40	. 
41	40Ω ) , then the effect is the same as if one had used two resistors with the same resistance , both equal to the harmonic mean of x and y ( 48Ω ) : the equivalent resistance in either case is 24Ω (one-half of the harmonic mean ) . 
42	However , if one connects the resistors in series , then the average resistance is the arithmetic mean of x and y ( with total resistance equal to the sum of x and y ) . 
43	And , as with previous example , the same principle applies when more than two resistors are connected , provided that all are in parallel or all are in series . 
44	In computer science , specifically information retrieval and machine learning , the harmonic mean of the precision and the recall is often used as an aggregated performance score for the evaluation of algorithms and systems : the F-score ( or F-measure ) . 
45	An interesting consequence arises from basic algebra in problems of working together . 
46	As an example , if a gas-powered pump can drain a pool in 4 hours and a battery-powered pump can drain the same pool in 6 hours , then it will take both pumps ( 6&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 )/( 6&nbsp;+&nbsp;4 ) , which is equal to 2.4 
47	hours , to drain the pool together . 
48	Interestingly , this is one-half of the harmonic mean of 6 and 4 . 
49	In hydrology the harmonic mean is used to average hydraulic conductivity values for flow that is perpendicular to layers ( e .g 
50	. 
51	geologic or soil ) while flow parallel to layers uses the arithmetic mean . 
52	This apparent difference in averaging is explained by the fact that hydrology uses conductivity , which is the inverse of resistivity . 
53	In sabermetrics , the Power-speed number of a player is the harmonic mean of his home run and stolen base totals . 
54	In population genetics the harmonic mean is used when calculating the effects of fluctuations in generation size on the effective breeding population . 
55	This is to take into account the fact that a very small generation is effectively like a bottleneck and means that a very small number of individuals are contributing disproportionately to the gene pool which can result in higher levels of inbreeding . 
56	When considering fuel economy in automobiles two measures are commonly used – miles per gallon ( mpg ) , and litres per 100&nbsp;km . 
57	As the dimensions of these quantities are the inverse of each other ( one is distance per volume , the other volume per distance ) when taking the mean value of the fuel-economy of a range of cars one measure will produce the harmonic mean of the other – i .e 
58	. 
59	converting the mean value of fuel economy expressed in litres per 100&nbsp;km to miles per gallon will produce the harmonic mean of the fuel economy expressed in miles-per-gallon . 
60	The harmonic mean is the preferable method for averaging multiples , such as the price/earning ratio , in which price is in the numerator . 
61	If these ratios are averaged using an arithmetic mean ( a common error ) , high data points are given greater weights than low data points . 
62	The harmonic mean , on the other hand , gives equal weight to each data point .

64	ISBN 0071429670 In any triangle , the radius of the incircle is one-third the harmonic mean of the altitudes . 
65	For any point P on the minor arc BC of the circumcircle of an equilateral triangle ABC , with distances q and t from B and C respectively , and with the intersection of PA and BC being at a distance y from point P , we have that y is half the harmonic mean of q and t .

71	In a right triangle with legs a and b and altitude h from the hypotenuse to the right angle , h 2 is half the harmonic mean of a 2 and b 2 .

74	Let t and s ( t > s ) be the sides of the two inscribed squares in a right triangle with hypotenuse c . 
75	Then s 2 equals half the harmonic mean of c 2 and t 2 . 
76	Let a trapezoid have vertices A , B , C , and D in sequence and have parallel sides AB and CD. 
77	Let E be the intersection of the diagonal , and let F be on side DA and G be on side BC such that FEG is parallel to AB and CD. 
78	Then FG is the harmonic mean of AB and DC . 
79	( This is provable using similar triangles . 
80	) thumbrightCrossed ladders . 
81	''h '' is half the harmonic mean of ''A '' and ''B '' In the crossed ladders problem , two ladders lie oppositely across an alley , each with feet at the base of one sidewall , with one leaning against a wall at height A and the other leaning against the opposite wall at height B , as shown . 
82	The ladders cross at a height of h above the alley floor . 
83	Then h is half the harmonic mean of A and B . 
84	This result still holds if the walls are slanted but still parallel and the "heights " A , B , and h are measured as distances from the floor along lines parallel to the walls . 
85	In an ellipse , the semi-latus rectum ( the distance from a focus to the ellipse along a line parallel to the minor axis ) is the harmonic mean of the maximum and minimum distances of the ellipse from a focus . 
86	In the case of the double-angle tangent identity , if the tangent of an angle A is given as a / b , then the tangent of 2 A is the product of ( 1 ) the harmonic mean of the numerator and denominator of tan A and ( 2 ) the reciprocal of ( the denominator minus the numerator of tan A ) . 
87	In general the double-angle formula can be written as if tan A = frac{a }{b } and a and b are real numbers . 
88	For example , if then the most familiar form of the double-angle formula is but this can also be written as For the special case of just two numbers x_1 and x_2 , the harmonic mean can be written In this special case , the harmonic mean is related to the arithmetic mean A = frac{x_1 + x_2 }{ 2 } and the geometric mean G = sqrt{x_1 x_2} , by So G = sqrt{ A H} , meaning the two numbers ' geometric mean equals the geometric mean of their arithmetic and harmonic means . 
89	As noted above this relationship between the three Pythagorean means is not limited to n equals 1 or 2 ; there is a relationship for all n . 
90	However it should be noted that for n equals 1 all means are equal and for n equals 2 we have the above relationship between the means . 
91	For arbitrary n≥2 we may generalize this formula , as noted above , by interpreting the third equation for the harmonic mean differently . 
92	The generalized relationship was already explained above . 
93	If one carefully observes the third equation one will notice it also works for n=1 . 
94	That is , it predicts the equivalence between the harmonic and geometric means but it falls short by not predicting the equivalence between the harmonic and arithmetic means . 
95	The general formula , which can be derived from the third formula for the harmonic mean by the reinterpretation as explained in relationship with other means , is Notice that for n=2 we have where we used the fact that the arithmetic mean evaluates to the same number independent of the order of the terms . 
96	This equation can be reduced to the original equation if we reinterpret this result in terms of the operators themselves . 
97	If we do this we get the symbolic equation because each function was evaluated at Statistics Mathematics descriptive Category :Means bg :Средно хармонично ca :Mitjana harmònica cs :Harmonický průměr da :Harmonisk gennemsnit de :Harmonisches Mittel es :Media armónica eo :Harmona meznombro eu:Batezbesteko harmoniko fa :میانگین هارمونیک fr :Moyenne harmonique gl:Media harmónica ko :조화 평균 hi :हरात्मक माध्य he :ממוצע הרמוני kk :Гармоникалық орта мән lt :Harmoninis vidurkis hu:Harmonikus közép nl :Harmonisch gemiddelde no :Harmonisk gjennomsnitt nn :Harmonisk gjennomsnitt pms :Media armònica pl :Średnia harmoniczna pt:Média harmônica ru:Среднее гармоническое sk :Harmonický priemer sl :Harmonična sredina sr :Хармонијска средина sh :Harmonijska sredina fi:Harmoninen keskiarvo sv :Harmoniskt medelvärde ta :இசைச ் சராசர ி tr :Harmonik ortalama ur :ایقاعی اوسط vi:Trung bình điều hòa zh :调和平均数 H = frac{n }{frac{1}{ x_1 } + frac{1}{ x_2 } + cdots + frac{1}{ x_n } } = frac{n }{sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{ x_i} } = frac{n cdot prod_{j=1}^n x_j } { sum_{i=1}^n frac{prod_{j=1}^n x_j }{ x_i}} .
