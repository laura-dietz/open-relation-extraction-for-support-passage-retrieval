0	the statistical concept In statistics , mean has two related meanings : There are other statistical measures that should not be confused with averages - including ' median ' and ' mode ' . 
1	Other simple statistical analyses use measures of spread , such as range , interquartile range , or standard deviation .For 
2	a real-valued random variable X , the mean is the expectation of X .Note 
3	that not every probability distribution has a defined mean ( or variance ) ; see the Cauchy distribution for an example . 
4	For a data set , the mean is the sum of the values divided by the number of values . 
5	The mean of a set of numbers x 1 , x 2 , ... 
6	, x n is typically denoted by bar{x } , pronounced " x bar" . 
7	This mean is a type of arithmetic mean . 
8	If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling a statistical population , this mean is termed the " sample mean " ( bar{x } ) to distinguish it from the "population mean " ( mu or mu x ) . 
9	The mean is often quoted along with the standard deviation : the mean describes the central location of the data , and the standard deviation describes the spread . 
10	An alternative measure of dispersion is the mean deviation , equivalent to the average absolute deviation from the mean . 
11	It is less sensitive to outliers , but less mathematically tractable . 
12	If a series of observations is sampled from a larger population ( measuring the heights of a sample of adults drawn from the entire world population , for example ) , or from a probability distribution which gives the probabilities of each possible result , then the larger population or probability distribution can be used to construct a "population mean" , which is also the expected value for a sample drawn from this population or probability distribution . 
13	For a finite population , this would simply be the arithmetic mean of the given property for every member of the population . 
14	For a probability distribution , this would be a sum or integral over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value . 
15	It is a universal convention to represent the population mean by the symbol mu .

22	Kuby , The sample mean may differ from the population mean , especially for small samples , but the law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample , the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean . 
23	Schaum 's Outline of Theory and Problems of Probability by Seymour Lipschutz and Marc Lipson , As well as statistics , means are often used in geometry and analysis ; a wide range of means have been developed for these purposes , which are not much used in statistics . 
24	These are listed below . 
25	Arithmetic mean The arithmetic mean is the " standard " average , often simply called the "mean " . 
26	The mean may often be confused with the median , mode or range . 
27	The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values , or distribution ; however , for skewed distributions , the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value ( median ) , or the most likely ( mode ) . 
28	For example , mean income is skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes , so that the majority have an income lower than the mean . 
29	By contrast , the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above . 
30	The mode income is the most likely income , and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes . 
31	The median or mode are often more intuitive measures of such data . 
32	Nevertheless , many skewed distributions are best described by their mean &ndash ; such as the exponential and Poisson distribution . 
33	For example , the arithmetic mean of six values : 5 , 10 , 13 , 7 , 25 , 31 is Geometric mean The geometric mean is an average that is useful for sets of positive numbers that are interpreted according to their product and not their sum ( as is the case with the arithmetic mean ) e.g 
34	. 
35	rates of growth . 
36	For example , the geometric mean of six values : 34 , 27 , 45 , 55 , 22 , 34 is : Harmonic mean \t The harmonic mean is an average which is useful for sets of numbers which are defined in relation to some unit , for example speed ( distance per unit of time ) . 
37	\t For example , the harmonic mean of the six values : 34 , 27 , 45 , 55 , 22 , and 34 is Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means AM , GM , and HM satisfy these inequalities : Equality holds only when all the elements of the given sample are equal . 
38	The generalized mean , also known as the power mean or Hölder mean , is an abstraction of the quadratic , arithmetic , geometric and harmonic means . 
39	It is defined for a set of n positive numbers x i by By choosing the appropriate value for the parameter m we get all means : This can be generalized further as the generalized f-mean and again a suitable choice of an invertible ƒ will give The weighted arithmetic mean is used , if one wants to combine average values from samples of the same population with different sample sizes : The weights w_i represent the bounds of the partial sample . 
40	In other applications they represent a measure for the reliability of the influence upon the mean by respective values . 
41	Sometimes a set of numbers might contain outliers , i .e 
42	. 
43	a datum which is much lower or much higher than the others .Often 
44	, outliers are erroneous data caused by artifacts . 
45	In this case one can use a truncated mean . 
46	It involves discarding given parts of the data at the top or the bottom end , typically an equal amount at each end , and then taking the arithmetic mean of the remaining data . 
47	The number of values removed is indicated as a percentage of total number of values . 
48	The interquartile mean is a specific example of a truncated mean . 
49	It is simply the arithmetic mean after removing the lowest and the highest quarter of values . 
50	assuming the values have been ordered , so is simply a specific example of a weighted mean for a specific set of weights . 
51	In calculus , and especially multivariable calculus , the mean of a function is loosely defined as the average value of the function over its domain . 
52	In one variable , the mean of a function f ( x ) over the interval ( a,b ) is defined by Recall that a defining property of the average value bar{y } of finitely many numbers y_1 , y_2 , dots , y_n is that nbar{y } = y_1 + y_2 + cdots + y_n . 
53	In other words , bar{y } is the constant value which when added to itself n times equals the result of adding the n terms of y_i . 
54	By analogy , adefining property of the average value bar{f } of a function over the interval [a ,b] is that In other words , bar{f } is the constant value which when integrated over [a ,b] equals the result ofintegrating f( x ) over [a ,b] . 
55	But by the second fundamental theorem of calculus , the integral of a constant bar{f } is just See also the first mean value theorem for integration , which guaranteesthat if f is continuous then there exists a point c in ( a , b ) such that The point f( c ) is called the mean value of f( x ) on [a ,b] . 
56	So we write bar{f } = f( c ) and rearrange the preceding equation to get the above definition . 
57	In several variables , the mean over a relatively compact domain U in a Euclidean space is defined by This generalizes the arithmetic mean . 
58	On the other hand , it is also possible to generalize the geometric mean to functions by defining the geometric mean of f to be More generally , in measure theory and probability theory either sort of mean plays an important role . 
59	In this context , Jensen 's inequality places sharp estimates on the relationship between these two different notions of the mean of a function . 
60	There is also a harmonic average of functions and a quadratic average ( or root mean square ) of functions . 
61	See expected value . 
62	Most of the usual means fail on circular quantities , like angle , daytimes , fractional part of real number . 
63	For those quantities you need a mean of circular quantities . 
64	The Fréchet mean gives a manner for determining the "center " of a mass distribution on a surface or , more generally , Riemannian manifold .

68	of these properties are collected here . 
69	A weighted mean M is a function which maps tuples of positive numbers to a positive number such that the following properties hold : It follows The above properties imply techniques to construct more complex means : If C , M 1 , ... 
70	, M m are weighted means and p is a positive real number ,then A and B defined by are also weighted means . 
71	Intuitively spoken , an unweighted mean is a weighted mean with equal weights .Since 
72	our definition of weighted mean above does not expose particular weights ,equal weights must be asserted by a different way .A 
73	different view on homogeneous weighting is , that the inputs can be swapped without altering the result . 
74	Thus we define M to be an unweighted mean if it is a weighted meanand for each permutation π of inputs , the result is the same . 
75	Analogously to the weighted means ,if C is a weighted mean and M 1 , ... 
76	, M m are unweighted means and p is a positive real number ,then A and B defined by are also unweighted means . 
77	An unweighted mean can be turned into a weighted mean by repeating elements.This 
78	connection can also be used to state that a mean is the weighted version of an unweighted mean.Say 
79	you have the unweighted mean M andweight the numbers by natural numbers a_1 ,dots ,a_n .( 
80	If the numbers are rational , then multiply them with the least common denominator .)Then 
81	the corresponding weighted mean A is obtained by If a mean M is defined for tuples of several sizes , then one also expects that the mean of a tuple is bounded by the means of partitions . 
82	More precisely The mean of a population has an expected value of μ , known as the population mean . 
83	The sample mean makes a good estimator of the population mean , as its expected value is the same as the population mean . 
84	The sample mean of a population is a random variable , not a constant , and consequently it will have its own distribution . 
85	For a random sample of n observations from a normally distributed population , the sample mean distribution is Often , since the population variance is an unknown parameter , it is estimated by the mean sum of squares , which changes the distribution of the sample mean from a normal distribution to a Student 's t distribution with n &nbsp;&minus ;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom .
