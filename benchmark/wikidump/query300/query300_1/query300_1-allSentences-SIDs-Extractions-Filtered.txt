Other simple statistical analyses use measures of spread , such as range , interquartile range , or standard deviation .For 	1
a real-valued random variable X , the mean is the expectation of X .Note 	2
that not every probability distribution has a defined mean ( or variance ) ; see the Cauchy distribution for an example . 	3

If a series of observations is sampled from a larger population ( measuring the heights of a sample of adults drawn from the entire world population , for example ) , or from a probability distribution which gives the probabilities of each possible result , then the larger population or probability distribution can be used to construct a "population mean" , which is also the expected value for a sample drawn from this population or probability distribution . 	12
