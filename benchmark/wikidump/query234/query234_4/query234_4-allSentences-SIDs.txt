1	Cocoa bean ( also cacao bean , often simply cocoa and cacao ; Mayan : kakaw ; Nahuatl : cacaua ) is the dried and fully fermented fatty seed of Theobroma cacao , from which cocoa solids and cocoa butter are extracted . 
2	They are the basis of chocolate , as well as many Mesoamerican foods such as mole sauce and tejate . 
3	A cocoa pod ( fruit ) has a rough leathery rind about 3&nbsp;cm thick ( this varies with the origin and variety of pod ) . 
4	It is filled with sweet , mucilaginous pulp ( called 'baba de cacao ' in South America ) enclosing 30 to 50 large seeds that are fairly soft and white to pale lavender in color . 
5	While seeds are usually white , they become violet or reddish brown during the drying process . 
6	The exception is rare varieties of white cacao , in which the seeds remain white .

30	2007-11-12 The cacao tree is native to the Americas . 
31	It may have originated in the foothills of the Andes in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America , current day Venezuela , where today , examples of wild cacao still can be found . 
32	However , it may have had a larger range in the past , evidence for which may be obscured because of its cultivation in these areas long before , as well as after , the Spanish arrived . 
33	It was first cultivated by the Olmec at least 1500 BC in Central America .

37	The cocoa bean was a common currency throughout Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest . 
38	Cacao trees will grow in a limited geographical zone , of approximately 20 degrees to the north and south of the Equator . 
39	Nearly 70 % of the world crop is grown in West Africa . 
40	Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica . 
41	A Spanish soldier who was part of the conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés tells that when Moctezuma II , emperor of the Aztec , dined , he took no other beverage than chocolate , served in a gold goblet . 
42	Flavored with vanilla or other spice , his chocolate was whipped into a froth that dissolved in the mouth . 
43	It is reported that no fewer than 50 portions each day may have been consumed by Moctezuma II , and 2000 more by the noble of his court .

68	thumbleftCocoa bean output in 2005 About 3000000 t on of cocoa is produced each year . 
69	The global production was The production increased by 131.7 
70	% in 30 years , representing a compound annual growth rate of 2.8 
71	% . 
72	There are three main varieties of cacao : Forastero , Criollo , and Trinitario . 
73	The first is the most widely used , comprising 95 % of the world production of cocoa . 
74	Overall , the highest quality cocoa beans come from the Criollo variety , which is considered a delicacy . 
75	Criollo plantation have lower yields than those of Forastero , and also tend to be less resistant to several diseases that attack the cocoa plant , hence very few countries still produce it . 
76	One of the largest producers of Criollo beans is Venezuela ( Chuao and Porcelana ) . 
77	Hacienda San José , located in Paria/Venezuela , cultivates Criollo beans . 
78	The total area of this hacienda is 320 hectares , of which 185 hectares are devoted to cacao , with a density of 1.000 
79	plants per hectare . 
80	Trinitario is a hybrid between Criollo and Forastero varieties . 
81	It is considered to be of much higher quality than the latter , but has higher yields and is more resistant to disease than the former . 
82	There are different metrics used for chocolate consumption . 
83	The Netherlands has the highest monetary amount of cocoa bean imports ( US$ 2.1 
84	billion ) ; it is also one of the main ports into Europe . 
85	The United States has highest amount of cocoa powder imports ( $ 220 million ) ; the US has a large amount of cocoa complementary products . 
86	The United Kingdom has the highest amount of retail chocolate ( $ 1.3 
87	billion ) and is one of the biggest chocolate consumption per capita markets . 
88	Cocoa and its products ( including chocolate ) are used worldwide . 
89	Per capita consumption is poorly understood , with numerous countries claiming the highest : various reports state Switzerland , Belgium , and the UK have the highest consumption , but it can be claimed that because there is no clear mechanism to determine how much of a country 's production is consumed by residents and how much by visitors , this is all speculative .

131	This makes harvesting by hand easier as most of the pods will not be up in the higher branches.The 
132	pods on a tree do not ripen together ; harvesting needs to be done periodically through the year . 
133	Harvesting occurs between 3–4 times to weekly during the harvest season . 
134	The ripe and near-ripe pods , as judged by their color , are harvested from the trunk and branches of the cocoa tree with a curved knife on a long pole . 
135	Care must be used when cutting the stem of the pod to avoid injuring the junction of the stem with the tree , as this is where future flowers and pods will emerge .

154	A typical pod contains 20 to 50 beans and about 400 dried beans are required to make one pound (880 per kilogram ) of chocolate . 
155	Cocoa pods weigh an average of 400 g lb 2 and each one yields 35 to 40 g lb 3 dried beans ( this yield is 40–44 % of the total weight in the pod ) . 
156	It is estimated one person can separate the beans from 2000 pods per day . 
157	The wet beans are transported then to a facility so they can be fermented and dried . 
158	They are fermented for four to seven days and must be mixed every two days . 
159	They are dried for five to fourteen days , depending on the climate conditions . 
160	thumbleftCacao drying square in front of church_Chuao_ Venezuela The harvested pods are opened—typically with a machete —the pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded . 
161	The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps , placed in bins , or laid out on grates for several days . 
162	During this time , the seeds and pulp undergo " sweating" , where the thick pulp liquefies as it ferments . 
163	The fermented pulp trickles away , leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected . 
164	Sweating is important for the quality of the beans , which originally have a strong bitter taste . 
165	If sweating is interrupted , the resulting cocoa may be ruined ; if underdone , the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potato and becomes susceptible to mildew . 
166	Some cocoa producing countries distil alcohol spirits using the liquefied pulp . 
167	thumbrightWoman drying cocoa The fermented beans are dried by spreading them out over a large surface and constantly raking them . 
168	In large plantation , this is done on huge trays under the sun or by using artificial heat . 
169	Small plantations may dry their harvest on little trays or on cowhide . 
170	Finally , the beans are trodden and shuffled about ( often using bare human feet ) and sometimes , during this process , red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color , polish , and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States , the Netherlands , United Kingdom , and other countries . 
171	Drying in the sun is preferable to drying by artificial means , as no extraneous flavors such as smoke or oil are introduced which might otherwise taint the flavor . 
172	The beans should be dry for shipment (usually by sea ) . 
173	Traditionally exported in jute bags , over the last decade the beans are increasingly shipped in ' Mega-Bulk ' bulk parcels of several thousand tonnes at a time on ships , or in smaller lots of around 25 tonnes in 20 foot containers . 
174	Shipping in bulk significantly reduces handling costs ; shipment in bags , however , either in a ship 's hold or in containers , is still commonly found .

177	The harvested and fermented beans may be ground to-order at tiendas de chocolate , or chocolate mills . 
178	At these mills , the cocoa can be mixed with a variety of ingredients such as cinnamon , chilies , almonds , vanilla and other spices to create drinking chocolate .

180	The ground cocoa is also an important ingredient in tejate and a number of savory foods , such as mole . 
181	Chocolate# Production Chocolate Production thumbrightChocolate To make 1&nbsp;kg ( 2.2&nbsp;pounds 
182	) of chocolate , about 300 to 600 beans are processed , depending on the desired cocoa content . 
183	In a factory , the beans are roasted . 
184	Next they are cracked and then de-shelled by a "winnower " . 
185	The resulting pieces of beans are called nibs . 
186	They are usually sold in small packages at specialty stores and markets to be used in cooking , snacking and chocolate dishes . 
187	Since nibs are directly from the cocoa tree , they contain high amounts of theobromine . 
188	Most nibs are ground , using various methods , into a thick creamy paste , known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste . 
189	This "liquor " is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in ( more ) cocoa butter and sugar ( and sometimes vanilla and lecithin as an emulsifier ) , and then refined , conche and tempered . 
190	Alternatively , it can be separated into cocoa powder and cocoa butter using a hydraulic press or the Broma process . 
191	This process produces around 50 % cocoa butter and 50 % cocoa powder . 
192	Standard cocoa powder has a fat content of approximately 10–12 percent . 
193	Cocoa butter is used in chocolate bar manufacture , other confectionery , soap , and cosmetics . 
194	Treating with alkali produces Dutch process cocoa powder , which is less acidic , darker and more mellow in flavor than what is generally available in most of the world . 
195	Regular ( non-alkalized ) cocoa is acidic , March 2010 chocolate is usually described as "bitter" , which is typical of alkaline substances — acidic would be sour so when cocoa is treated with an alkaline ingredient , generally potassium carbonate , the pH increases . 
196	March 2010 simply adding alkali would increase the pH , but the cocoa is " treated " with alkali This process can be done at various stages during manufacturing , including during nib treatment , liquor treatment or press cake treatment . 
197	Another process that helps develop the flavor is roasting . 
198	Roasting can be done on the whole bean before shelling or on the nib after shelling . 
199	The time and temperature of the roast affect the result : A "low roast " produces a more acid , aromatic flavor , while a high roast gives a more intense , bitter flavor lacking complex flavor notes . 
200	Chocolate and cocoa contain a high level of flavonoid , specifically epicatechin , which may have beneficial cardiovascular effects on health .

264	published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2006 found a 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular mortality and a 47 percent reduction in all-cause mortality for the men regularly consuming the most cocoa , compared to those consuming the least cocoa from all sources . 
265	Chocolate is a food product with appeal not only to the human population , but to many different animals as well . 
266	However , chocolate and cocoa contain a high level of xanthine , specifically theobromine and to a much lesser extent caffeine , that are detrimental to the health of many animals , including dog and cat . 
267	While these compounds have desirable effects in humans , they cannot be efficiently metabolized in many animals and can lead to cardiac and nervous system problems , and if consumed in high quantities , even lead to death . 
268	However , since the beginning of the 21st century , some cocoa derivatives with a low concentration of xanthines have been designed by specialized industry to be suitable for pet consumption , enabling the pet food industry to offer animal-safe chocolate and cocoa flavored products .

276	An initiative , called the , has developed from the growing requirement to face the challenges posed by sustainability . 
277	It was launched in 2007 by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) and is steered by an independent working group with representation of major stakeholders . 
278	The mission of the Roundtable is to establish a participatory and transparent process towards economic , environmental and social sustainability in the global cocoa economy . 
279	The 1st Roundtable in 2007 brought together more than 200 stakeholders representing 25 countries , including cocoa farmers , government officials from cocoa producing and consuming countries , traders , chocolate manufacturers , donor organizations and national and international NGOs . 
280	June 2010 Children in cocoa production The Cocoa Protocol is an effort to end these practices . 
281	It has , however , been criticized by some groups including the International Labor Rights Forum as an industry initiative which falls short . 
282	The relative poverty of many cocoa farmers means that environmental consequences such as deforestation are given little significance . 
283	For decades , cocoa farmers have encroached on virgin forest , mostly after the felling of trees by logging companies . 
284	This trend has decreased as many governments and communities are beginning to protect their remaining forested zones . 
285	April 2011 In general , the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by cocoa farmers is limited . 
286	When cocoa bean prices are high , farmers may invest in their crops , leading to higher yields which , in turn tends to result in lower market prices and a renewed period of lower investment . 
287	Cocoa beans , cocoa butter and cocoa powder are traded on two world exchanges : NYSE Euronext and IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE) . 
288	The London market is based on West African cocoa and New York on cocoa predominantly from Southeast Asia . 
289	Cocoa is the world 's smallest soft commodity market . 
290	The future price of cocoa butter and cocoa powder is determined by multiplying the bean price by a ratio . 
291	The combined butter and powder ratio has tended to be around 3.5 
292	. 
293	If the combined ratio falls below 3.2 
294	or so , production ceases to be economically viable and some factories cease extraction of butter and powder and trade exclusively in cocoa liquor . 
295	Cocoa beans can be held in storage for several years in bags or in bulk , during which the ownership can change several times , as the cocoa is traded much the same as metal or other commodities , to gain profit for the owner . 
296	In July 2010 , British hedge fund Armajaro , headed by speculator Anthony Ward , purchased 241,000 tonnes of cocoa beans . 
297	The purchase was valued at £658 million and caused cocoa bean prices to rise to their highest level since 1977 .

306	The first allegations that child slavery is used in cocoa production appeared in 1998 . 
307	The 2005 ILO report failed to fully characterize this problem , but estimated that up to 6 % of the 200,000 children involved in cocoa production could be victims of human trafficking or slavery .
