30	) 1 May 2007 In March 2007 , the Chocolate Manufacturers Association , whose members include Hershey 's , Nestlé , and Archer Daniels Midland , began lobbying the FDA to change the legal definition of chocolate to allow the substitution of " safe and suitable vegetable fats and oils " ( including partially hydrogenated vegetable oils ) for cocoa butter in addition to using "any sweetening agent " ( including artificial sweeteners ) and milk substitutes .

57	:ja :チョコレート# チョコレートの規格 ) . 
58	Chocolate is a product based on cocoa solid and/or cocoa fat . 
59	The amount and types of cocoa solids and fat that the term implies is a matter of controversy . 
60	Manufacturers have an incentive to use the term for variations that are cheaper to produce , containing less cocoa and cocoa substitutes , although these variations might not taste as good . 
61	There has been disagreement in the EU about the definition of chocolate ; this dispute covers several ingredients , including the types of fat used , quantity of cocoa , and so on . 
62	But , in 1999 , the EU at least resolved the fat issue by allowing up to 5 % of chocolate 's content to be one of 5 alternatives to cocoa butter : illipe oil , palm oil , sal , shea butter , kokum gurgi , or mango kernel oil .

120	2011-12-05 " Hershey process " milk chocolate is popular in North America . 
121	It was invented by Milton S. 
122	Hershey , founder of The Hershey Company , and can be produced more cheaply than other processes since it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk . 
123	The process is a trade secret , but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed , producing butyric acid , which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation . 
124	This compound gives the product a particular sour , "tangy " taste , to which the American public has become accustomed , to the point that other manufacturers now simply add butyric acid to their milk chocolates . 
125	" " , Julia Moskin , International Herald Tribune , 13 February 2008 thumbSwiss White chocolate " White chocolate " is a confection based on sugar , milk , and cocoa butter without the cocoa solids . 
126	" Cocoa powder " is used for baking , and for drinking with added milk and sugar . 
127	There are two types of unsweetened cocoa powder : natural cocoa ( like the sort produced by the Broma process ) , and Dutch-process cocoa . 
128	Both are made by pulverising partially defatted chocolate liquor and removing nearly all the cocoa butter ; Dutch-process cocoa is additionally processed with alkali to neutralise its natural acidity . 
129	Natural cocoa is light in colour and somewhat acidic with a strong chocolate flavour . 
130	Natural cocoa is commonly used in recipes that also use baking soda ; as baking soda is an alkali , combining it with natural cocoa creates a leavening action that allows the batter to rise during baking . 
131	Dutch cocoa is slightly milder in taste , with a deeper and warmer colour than natural cocoa . 
132	Dutch-process cocoa is frequently used for chocolate drinks such as hot chocolate due to its ease in blending with liquids . 
133	However , Dutch processing destroys most of the flavonoids present in cocoa .
