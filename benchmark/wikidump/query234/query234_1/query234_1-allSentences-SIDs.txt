1	Chocolate En-us-chocolate .ogg 
2	ˈ tʃ ɒ k ( ə ) l ɨ t is a raw or processed food produced from the seed of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree . 
3	Cacao has been cultivated for at least three millennia in Mexico , Central and South America . 
4	Its earliest documented use is around 1100 BC . 
5	The majority of the Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages , including the Aztec , who made it into a beverage known as xocolātl , a Nahuatl word meaning "bitter water " . 
6	The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste , and must be fermented to develop the flavor . 
7	After fermentation , the beans are dried , then cleaned , and then roasted , and the shell is removed to produce cacao nibs . 
8	The nibs are then ground to cocoa mass , pure chocolate in rough form . 
9	Because this cocoa mass usually is liquefied then molded with or without other ingredients , it is called chocolate liquor . 
10	The liquor also may be processed into two components : cocoa solids and cocoa butter . 
11	Unsweetened baking chocolate ( bitter chocolate ) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions . 
12	Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate , combining cocoa solids , cocoa butter or other fat , and sugar . 
13	Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk . 
14	White chocolate contains cocoa butter , sugar , and milk but no cocoa solids . 
15	Cocoa solids contain alkaloid such as theobromine and phenethylamine , which have physiological effects on the body . 
16	It has been linked to serotonin levels in the brain . 
17	Some research found that chocolate , eaten in moderation , can lower blood pressure .

45	By contrast , the Europeans never infused it into their general diet , but have compartmentalized its use to sweets and desserts . 
46	In the 19th century , Briton John Cadbury developed an emulsification process to make solid chocolate creating the modern chocolate bar . 
47	Although cocoa is originally from the Americas , today Western Africa produces almost two-thirds of the world 's cocoa , with Côte d'Ivoire growing almost half of it . 
48	The word " chocolate " entered the English language from Spanish .

61	17 May 2008 9 May 2009 How the word came into Spanish is less certain , and there are multiple competing explanations . 
62	Perhaps the most cited explanation is that " chocolate " comes from Nahuatl , the language of the Aztec , from the word chocolātl , which many sources derived from xocolātl ʃokolaːtɬ , from xococ ' sour ' or ' bitter ' , and ātl 'water ' or 'drink ' . 
63	However , as William Bright noted Campbell Lyle Quichean Linguistic Prehistory ; University of California Publications in Linguistics No.

65	81 Berkeley , California University of California Press 104 the word " chocolatl " does not occur in central Mexican colonial sources , making this an unlikely derivation .

68	412–413 Santamaria Francisco Diccionario de Mejicanismos Mexico Editorial Porrúa S. 
69	A. 
70	412–413 gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word " chokol " meaning hot , and the Nahuatl "atl " meaning water . 
71	Sophie and Michael D. 
72	Coe agree with this etymology . 
73	Pointing to various sources dating from the time period of the Spanish conquest , they identify cacahuatl ( " cacao water " ) as the original Nahuatl word for the cold beverage consumed by the Aztecs . 
74	Noting that using a word with caca in it to describe a thick , brown beverage would not have gone over well with most speakers of Spanish due to the fact that caca means faeces in Spanish , the Coes suggest that the Spanish colonisers combined the Nahuatl atl with the Yucatec Maya chocol , for unlike the Aztec , the Maya tended to drink chocolate heated . 
75	The Spanish preferred the warm Mayan preparation of the beverage to the cold Aztec one , and so the colonisers substituted chocol in place of the culturally unacceptable caca .

196	Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians , where with they feast noble men who pass through their country . 
197	The Spaniards , both men and women that are accustomed to the country are very greedy of this Chocolate . 
198	They say they make diverse sorts of it , some hot , some cold , and some temperate , and put therein much of that " chili" ; yea , they make paste thereof , the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh . 
199	The first recorded shipment of chocolate to Europe for commercial purposes was in a shipment from Veracruz to Sevilla in 1585 . 
200	It was still served as a beverage , but the Europeans added cane sugar to counteract the natural bitterness and removed the chili pepper while retaining the vanilla , in addition they added cinnamon as well as other spices . 
201	What the Spaniards then called " chocolatl " was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold .

252	For hundreds of years , the chocolate-making process remained unchanged . 
253	When the Industrial Revolution arrived , many changes occurred that brought about the food today in its modern form . 
254	A Dutch family 's ( van Houten ) inventions made mass production of shiny , tasty chocolate bars and related products possible . 
255	In the 18th century , mechanical mills were created that squeezed out cocoa butter , which in turn helped to create hard , durable chocolate .

271	Chocolate : A Contemporary Confection 1910—Today - Today 's Global Treat Field Museum 23 November 2011 At the end of the 18th century , the first form of solid chocolate was invented in Turin by Doret . 
272	This chocolate was sold in large quantities from 1826 by Pierre Paul Caffarel . 
273	In 1819 , F. 
274	L. 
275	Cailler opened the first Swiss chocolate factory . 
276	In 1828 , Dutchman Coenraad Johannes van Houten patented a method for extracting the fat from cocoa beans and making powdered cocoa and cocoa butter . 
277	Van Houten also developed the " so-called " Dutch process of treating chocolate with alkali to remove the bitter taste . 
278	This made it possible to form the modern chocolate bar . 
279	The German company Jordan &amp; Timaeus sold the first known chocolate bar made from cocoa , sugar and goat 's milk in 1839 .

287	S. 
288	Fry &amp; Sons discovered a way to mix some of the cocoa butter back into the Dutched chocolate , and added sugar , creating a paste that could be moulded . 
289	This led to the first British chocolate bar in 1847 , followed in 1849 by the Cadbury brothers . 
290	In 1865 , an unknown employee at the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company discovered the Broma process of separating cocoa butter from cocoa solids ( namely , that if chocolate is hung in a bag in a warm room , the butter will drip out naturally over time ) . 
291	Daniel Peter , a Swiss candle maker , joined his father-in-law 's chocolate business . 
292	In 1867 , he began experimenting with milk as an ingredient . 
293	He brought his new product , milk chocolate , to market in 1875 . 
294	He was assisted in removing the water content from the milk to prevent mildewing by a neighbour , a baby food manufacturer named Henri Nestlé . 
295	Rodolphe Lindt invented the process called conching , which involves heating and grinding the chocolate solids very finely to ensure that the liquid is evenly blended . 
296	This enabled Milton Hershey to make chocolate even more popular by mass producing affordable chocolate bars . 
297	Types of chocolate thumbrightA piece of milk chocolate withsalmiakfilling byFazer Several types of chocolate can be distinguished . 
298	Pure , unsweetened chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions . 
299	Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate , combining chocolate with sugar . 
300	Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk . 
301	In the U.K. 
302	and Ireland milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20 % total dry cocoa solids ; in the rest of the European Union the minimum is 25 % .

315	White chocolate is formed from a mixture of sugar , cocoa butter and milk solids . 
316	Although its texture is similar to milk and dark chocolate , it does not contain any cocoa solids . 
317	Because of this , many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate at all .

332	Food and Drug Administration 1 June 2008 Although first introduced by Hebert Candies in 1955 , Mars _ Incorporated was the first to produce white chocolate within the United States . 
333	Because it does not contain any cocoa solids , white chocolate does not contain any theobromine , meaning it can be consumed by animals . 
334	It is usually not used for cooking . 
335	Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture . 
336	The U.S. 
337	Food and Drug Administration calls this " sweet chocolate" , and requires a 15 % concentration of chocolate liquor . 
338	European rules specify a minimum of 35 % cocoa solids . 
339	Dark chocolate , with its high cocoa content , is a rich source of epicatechin and gallic acid , which are thought to possess cardioprotective properties . 
340	Dark chocolate has also been said to reduce the possibility of a heart attack when consumed regularly in small amounts .

345	Dark Chocolate Could Help Hearts CBS News 29 May 2008 30 August 2004 Semisweet chocolate is a dark chocolate with a low sugar content . 
346	Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third ) , more cocoa butter , vanilla and sometimes lecithin have been added . 
347	It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate , but the two are interchangeable in baking . 
348	Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor , also known as bitter or baking chocolate . 
349	It is unadulterated chocolate : the pure , ground , roasted chocolate beans impart a strong , deep chocolate flavor . 
350	Raw chocolate , often referred to as raw cacao , is always dark and a minimum of 75 % cacao . 
351	Because the act of processing results in the loss of certain vitamins and minerals ( such as magnesium ) , some consider raw cacao to be a more nutritious form of chocolate .

444	Criollo Chocolate : Efficient Food of the Gods MetaEfficient 17 May 2008 There is some dispute about the genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo , as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties . 
445	Criollos are particularly difficult to grow , as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree . 
446	The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex , low in classic chocolate flavor , but rich in " secondary " notes of long duration .

460	The African cocoa crop is entirely of the forastero variety . 
461	They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo . 
462	The source of most chocolate marketed , forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic " chocolate " flavor , but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors , producing "quite bland " chocolate . 
463	Trinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero . 
464	Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop . 
465	Nearly all cacao produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties .

504	At the chocolate factory The Cocoa Tree 20 May 2008 Types of chocolate Chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couvertures . 
505	The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate ( in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first ) , are as follows : thumbuprightleftFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter _ allowing it to flow gently over achocolate fountainto serve asChocolate fonduedessert fondue . 
506	Usually , an emulsifying agent , such as soy lecithin , is added , though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO -free , sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture . 
507	Some manufacturers are now using PGPR , an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel . 
508	The texture is also heavily influenced by processing , specifically conching ( see below ) . 
509	The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel , regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added . 
510	Different manufacturers develop their own " signature " blends based on the above formulas , but varying proportions of the different constituents are used . 
511	The finest , plain dark chocolate couvertures contain at least 70 % cocoa ( both solids and butter ) , whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50 % . 
512	High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35 % cocoa . 
513	Producers of high quality , small batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad quality chocolate . 
514	Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa ( as low as 7 % in many cases ) , and fats other than cocoa butter . 
515	Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans . 
516	In 2007 , the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States , whose members include Hershey , Nestlé , and Archer Daniels Midland , lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter , in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes .

537	Food and Drug Administration 9 June 2007 PDF Conching thumbChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients The penultimate process is called conching . 
538	A conche is a container filled with metal beads , which act as grinders . 
539	The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat . 
540	Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture . 
541	The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect , hence the smooth feel in the mouth . 
542	The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate . 
543	High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72&nbsp;hours , lesser grades about four to six hours . 
544	After the process is complete , the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to approximately 45 – 50 C F until final processing .

551	Conching : Crucial Step in Chocolate’s Flavor and Texture ? Sally 's Place 20 May 2008 The final process is called temper . 
552	Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size , some or all large enough to be clearly seen with the naked eye . 
553	This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte , and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken . 
554	The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process . 
555	The fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms ( polymorphous crystallization ) . 
556	The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present . 
557	The six different crystal forms have different properties . 
558	thumbMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar Making chocolate considered "good " is about forming as many type V crystals as possible . 
559	This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals , so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time . 
560	To accomplish this , the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization . 
561	Generally , the chocolate is first heated to 45 °C °F on to melt all six forms of crystals .

568	20 May 2008 Next , the chocolate is cooled to about 27 °C °F on , which will allow crystal types IV and V to form . 
569	At this temperature , the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal " seeds " which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate . 
570	The chocolate is then heated to about 31 °C °F on to eliminate any type IV crystals , leaving just type V. 
571	After this point , any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated . 
572	However , there are other methods of chocolate tempering used . 
573	The most common variant is introducing already tempered , solid " seed " chocolate . 
574	The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency . 
575	A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results . 
576	Two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are : Chocolate tempering machines ( or temperers ) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate , particularly for large volume applications . 
577	Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity . 
578	Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 C F , with a relative humidity of less than 50 % . 
579	Various types of " blooming " effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly . 
580	Fat bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 C while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 C or excess humidity . 
581	To distinguish between different types of bloom , one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly , and if the bloom disappears , it is fat bloom . 
582	One can get rid of bloom by re-tempering the chocolate or using it for anything that requires melting the chocolate .

586	pp . 
587	147 . 
588	ISBN 978-2-08-020081-5 Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods , as it can absorb different aromas . 
589	Ideally , chocolates are packed or wrapped , and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature . 
590	Additionally , chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper . 
591	If refrigerated or frozen without containment , chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration , the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface . 
592	Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another , such as from a refrigerator on a hot day , can result in an oily texture . 
593	Although visually unappealing , chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption .

639	Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter , a fat which is removed during chocolate refining , then added back in in varying proportions during the manufacturing process . 
640	Manufacturers may add other fats , sugar , and milk as well , all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate . 
641	Chocolate absorbs lead from the environment during production , and there is a slight concern of mild lead poisoning for some types of chocolate .
