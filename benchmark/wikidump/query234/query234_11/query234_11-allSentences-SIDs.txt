15	chocolate/ Chocolate can do good things for your heart , skin and brain CNN Health 20 May 2008 December 2010 Article says nothing about effects related to cancer , cough or diarrhea That chocolate has an aphrodisiac effect is yet to be a well supported claim . 
16	On the other hand , the unconstrained consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food , such as chocolate , without a corresponding increase in activity increases the risk of obesity . 
17	Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter , a fat which is removed during chocolate refining , then added back in at varying proportions during the manufacturing process . 
18	Manufacturers may add other fats , sugar , and milk as well , all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate . 
19	Chocolate absorbs lead from the environment during production and there is concern of mild lead poisoning for some types of chocolate . 
20	Additionally , chocolate is toxic to many animals because of insufficient capacity to metabolize theobromine .

33	July 2011 When drugs are used to block the brain 's opiate receptors , the desire for chocolate disappears , confirming the addictive nature of these types of foods . 
34	July 2011 Research on rats has determined that increased chocolate intake enhances the expression of MKP in the trigeminal ganglion , lowering the level of CGRP and other inflammatory chemicals , suppressing the symptoms of migraine . 
35	Cady , Ryan and Durham , Paul " Cocoa-enriched diets enhance expression of phosphatases and decrease expression of inflammatory molecules in trigeminal ganglion neurons " Brain Research 1/29/2010 Recent studies have suggested that cocoa or dark chocolate may produce certain beneficial effects on human health . 
36	This is mainly caused by a particular substance present in cocoa called epicatechin . 
37	Cocoa possesses a significant antioxidant action , protecting against LDL oxidation , perhaps more than other polyphenol antioxidant -rich foods and beverages . 
38	Chocolate phenols have been shown to protect the arteries from plaque formation and to prevent LDL oxidation for two hours after consumption .

68	Heart-Health Benefits of Chocolate Unveiled Cleveland Clinic Miller Family Heart &amp; Vascular Institute February 2010 4 September 2010 One-third of the fat in chocolate comes from the monounsaturated fat oleic acid , another one-third from the saturated fat stearic acid , and another one-third from the saturated fat palmitic acid . 
69	However , unlike other saturated fats , stearic acid does not raise levels of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream and has neutral effects on cholesterol . 
70	Stearic acid can be converted to oleic acid in the liver . 
71	Consuming relatively large amounts of dark chocolate and cocoa does not seem to raise serum LDL cholesterol levels ; some studies even find that it could lower them .

151	Chocolate 'cuts death rate ' in heart attack survivors AFP Marlowe Hood 13 August 2009 13 August 2009 October 2010 H3llBot Romantic lore commonly identifies chocolate as an aphrodisiac . 
152	The reputed aphrodisiac qualities of chocolate are most often associated with the simple sensual pleasure of its consumption . 
153	Although there is no proof that chocolate is indeed an aphrodisiac , a gift of chocolate is a familiar courtship ritual . 
154	Research looking at the psychoactivity of chocolate reveals that methylxanthine , an active biological substance found in chocolate , competes with adenosine , a presynaptic inhibitor modulator , and blocks its receptor .

201	?view=long&pmid=16177189 The major concern that nutritionists have is that even though eating dark chocolate may not affect serum cholesterol , blood pressure or LDL oxidation , it is not known whether it affects certain biomarker of cardiovascular disease . 
202	Furthermore , the amount needed to have this effect would provide a relatively large quantity of calories , which , if unused , would promote weight gain . 
203	Obesity is a significant risk factor for many diseases , including cardiovascular disease . 
204	As a consequence , consuming large quantities of dark chocolate in an attempt to protect against cardiovascular disease has been described as 'cutting off one 's nose to spite one 's face ' .

283	Theobromine poisoning In sufficient amounts , the theobromine found in chocolate is toxic to animals such as horses , dogs , parrots , small rodents , and cats because they are unable to metabolise the chemical effectively . 
284	If they are fed chocolate , the theobromine will remain in their bloodstream for up to 20 hours , and these animals may experience epileptic seizure , heart attacks , internal bleeding , and eventually death . 
285	Medical treatment performed by a veterinarian involves inducing vomiting within two hours of ingestion and administration of benzodiazepine or barbiturate for seizures , antiarrhythmics for heart arrhythmias , and fluid diuresis . 
286	A typical 20 kg lb on dog will normally experience great intestinal distress after eating less than 240 g oz of dark chocolate , but will not necessarily experience bradycardia or tachycardia unless it eats at least a half a kilogram ( 1.1&nbsp;lb 
287	) of milk chocolate . 
288	Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs . 
289	According to the Merck Veterinary Manual , approximately 1.3 
290	grams of baker 's chocolate per kilogram of a dog 's body weight ( 0.02 
291	oz/lb ) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity . 
292	For example , a typical 25 g oz on baker 's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a 20 kg lb on dog . 
293	Of course , baking chocolate is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste , but other dark chocolates ' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure . 
294	Given access , dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products and are capable of finding and eating quantities much larger than typical human servings . 
295	There are reports that mulch made from cacao bean shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock .

311	White chocolate contains only trace amounts of the caffeine and theobromine of normal chocolates , because these chemicals are contained in the cocoa solids , not the cocoa butter , from which white chocolate is made . 
312	Chocolate is rich in phenolics especially flavan-3-ol ( catechins ) and flavonoid .The
