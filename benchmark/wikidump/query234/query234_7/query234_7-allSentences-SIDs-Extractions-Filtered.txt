The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be at least partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin in such species ; thus , the blood returned to the heart through the vena cavae is , in fact , already partially oxygenated . 	125

As a result , there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapod . 	126
Nonetheless , in at least some species of amphibian , the spongy nature of the ventricle seems to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams than appears the case at first glance . 	127

"the septum"	"is much larger"	"generally"	129

This divides the ventricle into two halves but , because the septum does not reach the whole length of the heart , there is a considerable gap near the openings to the pulmonary artery and the aorta . 	130
