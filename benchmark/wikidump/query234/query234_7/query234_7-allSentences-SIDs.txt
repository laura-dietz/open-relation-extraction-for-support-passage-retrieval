1	Normal heart sounds Normal heart sounds as heard with a stethoscope Ogg thumbReal-time MRIof the human heart The heart is a myogenic muscular organ found in all animal with a circulatory system ( including all vertebrate ) , which pumps blood throughout the blood vessel by repeated , rhythmic contractions . 
2	The term cardiac ( as in cardiology ) means "related to the heart " and comes from the Greek καρδιά , kardia , for "heart " . 
3	The vertebrate heart is composed of cardiac muscle , which is an involuntary striated muscle tissue found only in this organ , and connective tissue . 
4	The average human heart , beating at 72 beats per minute , will beat approximately 2.5 
5	billion times during an average 66 year lifespan . 
6	It weighs approximately 250 to 300 g oz 0 in females and 300 to 350 g oz 0 in males .

9	556 In invertebrate that possess a circulatory system , the heart is typically a tube or small sac and pumps fluid that contains water and nutrients such as protein , fat , and sugar . 
10	In insect , the "heart " is often called the dorsal tube and insect "blood " is almost always not oxygenated since they usually respirate ( breathe ) directly from their body surfaces ( internal and external ) to air . 
11	However , the hearts of some other arthropod ( including spiders and crustacean such as crab and shrimp ) and some other animals pump hemolymph , which contains the copper -based protein hemocyanin as an oxygen transporter similar to the iron -based hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates . 
12	Heart development The mammalian heart is derived from embryonic mesoderm germ-layer cells that differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium , endothelium , and myocardium . 
13	Mesothelial pericardium forms the outer lining of the heart . 
14	The inner lining of the heart , lymphatic and blood vessels , develop from endothelium . 
15	Heart muscle is termed myocardium .

25	In the cardiogenic plates , two separate angiogenic cell clusters form on either side of the embryo . 
26	The cell clusters coalesce to form an endocardial tube continuous with a dorsal aorta and a vitteloumbilical vein . 
27	As embryonic tissue continues to fold , the two endocardial tubes are pushed into the thoracic cavity , begin to fuse together , and complete the fusing process at approximately 22 days .

36	2010-10-17 thumb300pxAt 22 days afterFertilizationconception _ the human heart begins beating at 70 to 80 beats per minute and accelerates linearly for the first month of beating . 
37	The human embryon heart begins beating at around 22 days after conception , or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period ( LMP ) . 
38	The first day of the LMP is normally used to date the start of the gestation ( pregnancy ) . 
39	The human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother’s , about 75–80 beats per minute ( BPM) . 
40	The embryonic heart rate ( EHR ) then accelerates by approximately 100 BPM during the first month to peak at 165–185 BPM during the early 7th week afer conception , ( early 9th week after the LMP ) . 
41	This acceleration is approximately 3.3 
42	BPM per day , or about 10 BPM every three days , which is an increase of 100 BPM in the first month .

64	( See Circulatory system . 
65	) Cephalopod have two "gill hearts " and one " systemic heart " . 
66	In vertebrates , the heart lies in the anterior part of the body cavity , dorsal to the gut . 
67	It is always surrounded by a pericardium , which is usually a distinct structure , but may be continuous with the peritoneum in jawless and cartilaginous fish . 
68	Hagfish , uniquely among vertebrates , also possess a second heart-like structure in the tail .

73	It is enclosed in a double-walled sac called the pericardium . 
74	The superficial part of this sac is called the fibrous pericardium . 
75	This sac protects the heart , anchors its surrounding structures , and prevents overfilling of the heart with blood . 
76	The outer wall of the human heart is composed of three layers . 
77	The outer layer is called the epicardium , or visceral pericardium since it is also the inner wall of the pericardium . 
78	The middle layer is called the myocardium and is composed of muscle which contracts . 
79	The inner layer is called the endocardium and is in contact with the blood that the heart pumps . 
80	Also , it merges with the inner lining ( endothelium ) of blood vessels and covers heart valves .

100	Deoxygenated blood flows through the heart in one direction , entering through the superior vena cava into the right atrium and is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle before being pumped out through the pulmonary valve to the pulmonary arteries into the lungs . 
101	It returns from the lungs through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium where it is pumped through the mitral valve into the left ventricle before leaving through the aortic valve to the aorta .

108	Print thumbright350pxSchematic of simplified fish heart Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart , but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds . 
109	The first chamber is the sinus venosus , which collects de-oxygenated blood , from the body , through the hepatic and cardinal vein . 
110	From here , blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place . 
111	The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta . 
112	The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows , through the dorsal aorta , into the rest of the body . 
113	( In tetrapod , the ventral aorta has divided in two ; one half forms the ascending aorta , while the other forms the pulmonary artery ) . 
114	In the adult fish , the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but , instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two . 
115	This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish . 
116	In teleost , the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper . 
117	The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniote , presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution . 
118	Similarly , while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds , it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable . 
119	In amphibian and most reptile , a double circulatory system is used but the heart is not completely separated into two pumps . 
120	The development of the double system is necessitated by the presence of lung which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart . 
121	In living amphibians , the atrium is divided into two separate chambers by the presence of a muscular septum even though there is only one ventricle . 
122	The sinus venosus , which remains large in amphibians but connects only to the right atrium , receives blood from the vena cava , with the pulmonary vein by-passing it entirely to enter the left atrium . 
123	In the heart of lungfish , the septum extends part-way into the ventricle . 
124	This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body . 
125	The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be at least partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin in such species ; thus , the blood returned to the heart through the vena cavae is , in fact , already partially oxygenated . 
126	As a result , there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapod . 
127	Nonetheless , in at least some species of amphibian , the spongy nature of the ventricle seems to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams than appears the case at first glance . 
128	Furthermore , the conus arteriosus has lost its original valves and contains a spiral valve , instead , that divides it into two parallel parts , thus helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate . 
129	The heart of most reptiles ( except for crocodilians ; see below ) has a similar structure to that of lungfish but , here , the septum is generally much larger . 
130	This divides the ventricle into two halves but , because the septum does not reach the whole length of the heart , there is a considerable gap near the openings to the pulmonary artery and the aorta . 
131	In practice , however , in the majority of reptilian species , there appears to be little , if any , mixing between the bloodstreams , so the aorta receives , essentially , only oxygenated blood .

145	In crocodilians , there is a small opening , the foramen of Panizza , at the base of the arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart ; thus , only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – kept entirely separate by a physical barrier .

148	1977 The Vertebrate Body Holt-Saunders International Philadelphia , PA 437–442 0-03-910284-X In the human body , the heart is usually situated in the middle of the thorax with the largest part of the heart slightly offset to the left , although sometimes it is on the right ( see dextrocardia ) , underneath the sternum . 
149	The heart is usually felt to be on the left side because the left heart ( left ventricle ) is stronger ( it pumps to all body parts ) . 
150	The left lung is smaller than the right lung because the heart occupies more of the left hemithorax . 
151	The heart is fed by the coronary circulation and is enclosed by a sac known as the pericardium ; it is also surrounded by the lung . 
152	The pericardium comprises two parts : the fibrous pericardium , made of dense fibrous connective tissue , and a double membrane structure ( parietal and visceral pericardium ) containing a serous fluid to reduce friction during heart contractions . 
153	The heart is located in the mediastinum , which is the central sub-division of the thoracic cavity . 
154	The mediastinum also contains other structures , such as the esophagus and trachea , and is flanked on either side by the right and left pulmonary cavities ; these cavities house the lung .

172	Blue components indicate de-oxygenated blood pathways and red components indicate oxygenated pathways . 
173	rightthumb450pxImage showing theconduction system of the heart In mammals , the function of the right side of the heart ( see right heart ) is to collect de-oxygenated blood , in the right atrium , from the body (via superior and inferior vena cavae ) and pump it , through the tricuspid valve , via the right ventricle , into the lungs ( pulmonary circulation ) so that carbon dioxide can be dropped off and oxygen picked up ( gas exchange ) . 
174	This happens through the passive process of diffusion . 
175	The left side ( see left heart ) collects oxygenated blood from the lung into the left atrium . 
176	From the left atrium the blood moves to the left ventricle , through the bicuspid valve , which pumps it out to the body (via the aorta ) . 
177	On both sides , the lower ventricles are thicker and stronger than the upper atria.The 
178	muscle wall surrounding the left ventricle is thicker than the wall surrounding the right ventricle due to the higher force needed to pump the blood through the systemic circulation . 
179	Starting in the right atrium , the blood flows through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle . 
180	Here , it is pumped out the pulmonary semilunar valve and travels through the pulmonary artery to the lungs . 
181	From there , oxygenated blood flows back through the pulmonary vein to the left atrium . 
182	It then travels through the mitral valve to the left ventricle , from where it is pumped through the aortic semilunar valve to the aorta . 
183	The aorta forks and the blood is divided between major arteries which supply the upper and lower body . 
184	The blood travels in the arteries to the smaller arterioles and then , finally , to the tiny capillaries which feed each cell . 
185	The ( relatively ) deoxygenated blood then travels to the venules , which coalesce into veins , then to the inferior and superior venae cavae and finally back to the right atrium where the process began . 
186	The heart is effectively a syncytium , a meshwork of cardiac muscle cells interconnected by contiguous cytoplasmic bridges . 
187	This relates to electrical stimulation of one cell spreading to neighboring cells . 
188	Some cardiac cells are self-excitable , contracting without any signal from the nervous system , even if removed from the heart and placed in culture . 
189	Each of these cells have their own intrinsic contraction rhythm . 
190	A region of the human heart called the sinoatrial ( SA ) node , or pacemaker , sets the rate and timing at which all cardiac muscle cells contract . 
191	The SA node generates electrical impulses , much like those produced by nerve cells . 
192	Because cardiac muscle cells are electrically coupled by inter-calated disks between adjacent cells , impulses from the SA node spread rapidly through the walls of the artria , causing both artria to contract in unison . 
193	The impulses also pass to another region of specialized cardiac muscle tissue , a relay point called the atrioventricular node , located in the wall between the right atrium and the right ventricle . 
194	Here , the impulses are delayed for about 0.1s 
195	before spreading to the walls of the ventricle . 
196	The delay ensures that the artria empty completely before the ventricles contract . 
197	Specialized muscle fibers called Purkinje fibers then conduct the signals to the apex of the heart along and throughout the ventricular walls . 
198	The Purkinje fibres form conducting pathways called bundle branches . 
199	This entire cycle , a single heart beat , lasts about 0.8 
200	seconds . 
201	The impulses generated during the heart cycle produce electrical currents , which are conducted through body fluids to the skin , where they can be detected by electrodes and recorded as an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) .

209	In these animals , the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers . 
210	Indeed , since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes , it is likely homologous with the SA node . 
211	In teleosts , with their vestigial sinus venosus , the main centre of coordination is , instead , in the atrium . 
212	The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species , ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbird . 
213	Cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of normal heart rhythm which can include a number of pathologies such as tachycardia , an extremely rapid heart beat which prevents the heart from effectively pumping blood , which is an irregular and ineffective heart rhythm , and asystole , which is the cessation of heart rhythm entirely . 
214	Cardiac tamponade is a condition in which the fibrous sac surrounding the heart fills with excess fluid or blood , suppressing the heart 's ability to beat properly . 
215	Tamponade is treated by pericardiocentesis , the gentle insertion of the needle of a syringe into the pericardial sac (avoiding the heart itself ) on an angle , usually from just below the sternum , and gently withdrawing the tamponading fluids . 
216	thumbHeart and its blood vessels _ byLeonardo da Vinci_ 15th century The valves of the heart were discovered by a physician of the Hippocratean school around the 4th century BC , although their function was not fully understood . 
217	On dissection , arteries are typically empty of blood because of the fact that blood pools in the veins after death . 
218	Ancient anatomists subsequently assumed they were filled with air and served to transport it around the body . 
219	Philosophers distinguished veins from arteries , but thought the pulse was a property of arteries themselves . 
220	Erasistratos observed that arteries cut during life bleed . 
221	He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood which entered by very small vessels between veins and arteries . 
222	Thus he apparently postulated capillaries , but with reversed flow of blood . 
223	The Greek physician Galen ( 2nd century AD ) knew blood vessels carried blood and identified venous ( dark red ) and arterial ( brighter and thinner ) blood , each with distinct and separate functions . 
224	Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle , while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air ) and originated in the heart . 
225	Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body , where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver . 
226	The heart did not pump blood around , the heart 's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves . 
227	Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores ' in the interventricular septum , while air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart .
