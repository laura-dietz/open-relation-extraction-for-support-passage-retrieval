22	Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications , including the International Classification of Functioning _ Disability and Health ( ICF ) and the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) , are commonly used to define and measure the components of health . 
23	The maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical , mental , and social well-being , together sometimes referred to as the “health triangle ” .

37	Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are delivered by health care provider . 
38	Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences . 
39	The term "healthy " is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans , such as in the sense of healthy communities , healthy cities or healthy environment . 
40	In addition to health care interventions and a person 's surroundings , a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals , including their background , lifestyle , and economic and social conditions ; these are referred to as "determinants of health" . 
41	Social determinants of health Risk factor Generally , the context in which an individual lives is of great importance on health status and quality of life . 
42	It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science , but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society . 
43	According to the World Health Organization , the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment , the physical environment , and the person 's individual characteristics and behaviors .

61	The concept of the " health field " , as distinct from medical care , emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada . 
62	The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual 's health . 
63	These are : Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health , data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise , enough sleep , maintaining a healthy body weight , limiting alcohol use , and avoiding smoking .

71	The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals . 
72	This includes characteristics of the natural environment , the built environment , and the social environment .

78	J Epidemiol Community Health 2008 ;62:e2 This suggests the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use . 
79	Genetics , or inherited traits from parents , also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations . 
80	This can encompass both the predisposition to certain diseases and health conditions , as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their families . 
81	For example , genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with stress , either mental , emotional or physical . 
82	( One difficulty in this is the debate over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors ; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance .

84	Health science Health care thumb210pxThe Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of theDutch East Indies _ May 1946 Health science is the branch of science focused on health . 
85	There are two main approaches to health science : the study and research of the body and health-related issues to understand how humans ( and animals ) function ; and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure disease and other physical and mental impairments . 
86	The science builds on many sub fields , including biology , biochemistry , physics , epidemiology , pharmacology , medical sociology , and others . 
87	Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as health education , biomedical engineering , biotechnology and public health . 
88	Organized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are delivered among practitioners trained in medicine , nursing , nutrition , pharmacy , social work , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy and other health care professions . 
89	Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals , while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations . 
90	Workplace wellness programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees , as are school health services to improve the health and well-being of children .

102	The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents ( for instance , in the case of a pandemic ) . 
103	Public health has many sub-fields , but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology , biostatistics and health services . 
104	Environmental health , community health , behavioral health , and occupational health , are also important areas of public health . 
105	The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases , injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors , communities , and ( in aspects relevant to human health ) environments . 
106	Its aim is preventing from happening or re-occurring health problems by implementing educational programs , developing policies , administering services , and conducting research .

109	Vaccination programs and distribution of condom to prevent the spread of communicable disease are examples of common preventive public health measures , as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms ( including overcoming resistance to such ) . 
110	Public health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and , in some cases , the continent or world . 
111	One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care , in terms of financial , geographical or sociocultural constraints in access to and use of services . 
112	November 2011 Applications of the public health system include areas of maternal and child health , health services administration , emergency response , and prevention and control of infectious and chronic disease . 
113	The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged . 
114	Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health , the 20th century registered a decrease of the mortality rates in infants and child and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world .

122	These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease , usually a chronic condition , through integrative care . 
123	They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness , such as bathing and washing hands with soap ; brushing and flossing teeth ; storing , preparing and handling food safely ; and many others . 
124	The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living - such as about sleep patterns , exercise behavior , nutritional intake , and environmental features - may be used to inform personal decisions and actions ( e.g 
125	. 
126	, " I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow" ) , as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans ( e.g

132	The maintenance of strong social relation , volunteering , and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and even increased longevity .

142	Psychological methods include cognitive therapy , meditation , and positive thinking which work by reducing response to stress . 
143	Improving relevant skills , such as problem solving and time management skills , reduces uncertainty and builds confidence , which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable .
