41	February 16 , 2008 yes Chamberlain was subsequently enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978 , elected into the NBA 's 35th Anniversary Team of 1980 , and chosen as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History of 1996 . 
42	Chamberlain was known by various nickname during his basketball playing career . 
43	He hated the ones that called attention to his height such as Goliath and Wilt the Stilt , which was coined during his high school days by a Philadelphia sportswriter . 
44	He preferred The Big Dipper , which was inspired by his friends who saw him dip his head as he walked through door . 
45	He was also called the Chairman of the Boards . 
46	After his basketball career ended , Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association , was president of this organization , and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame for his contributions . 
47	Chamberlain also was a successful businessman , authored several books , and appeared in the movie Conan the Destroyer . 
48	He was a lifelong bachelor , and became notorious for his claim to having had sex with over 20,000 women .

53	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , into a family of nine children . 
54	As his biographer Robert Cherry observed , he was a frail child , nearly dying of pneumonia in his early years and missing a whole year of school as a result . 
55	Wilt : Larger Than Life , Robert Cherry , Triumph Books ( Chicago , 2004 ) , 3. 
56	In his early years Chamberlain was not interested in basketball , because he thought it was " a game for sissies " . 
57	Cherry , 8. 
58	Instead , he was an avid track and field athlete : as a youth , he high jump 6&nbsp;feet , 6&nbsp;inches , ran the 440&nbsp;yards in 49.0 
59	seconds and the 880&nbsp;yards in 1:58.3 
60	, put the shot 53&nbsp;feet , 4&nbsp;inches , and broad jump 22&nbsp;feet .

63	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 But according to Chamberlain , "basketball was king in Philadelphia " , so he eventually turned to the sport . 
64	Cherry , 19 . 
65	Because Chamberlain was a very tall child , already measuring 6 feet at age 10 Cherry , 9 . 
66	and 6 feet 11&nbsp;inches when he entered Philadelphia 's Overbrook High School , he had a natural advantage against his peers ; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent , his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities . 
67	Cherry , 20–21 . 
68	According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock , Chamberlain was "scary , flat-out frightening ... 
69	before he came along , most basketball players were mortal-sized men . 
70	Chamberlain changed that .

73	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 It was also in this period of his life when his three life-long nicknames " Wilt the Stilt " , " Goliath " , and his favorite , " The Big Dipper" , were allegedly born . 
74	As a player for the Overbrook Panthers , Chamberlain averaged 31 points during the 1953 high school season and led his team to a 71–62 win against the Northeast High School of his future NBA teammate Guy Rodgers . 
75	He scored 34 points , won Overbrook the Public League title and a berth for the Philadelphia city championship game against the winner of the rival Catholic league , West Catholic . 
76	Cherry , 25–26 . 
77	In that game , West Catholic triple-teamed Chamberlain the entire game , and despite the center 's 29 points , the Panthers lost 54-42 . 
78	In his second Overbrook season , Chamberlain continued his prolific scoring , among them scoring a high school record 71 points against Roxborough . 
79	The Panthers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast in which Chamberlain scored 40 points , and later won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74–50 . 
80	Chamberlain scored 32 points and had led Overbrook to a flawless 19–0 season . 
81	Cherry , 30 . 
82	During summer vacations Chamberlain worked as a bellhop in Kutsher 's Hotel . 
83	Red Auerbach , the coach of the Boston Celtics , spotted the talented teenager there and had him play 1-on-1 against Kansas University standout and national champion , B. 
84	H. 
85	Born , elected the Most Valuable Player of the 1953 NCAA Finals . 
86	Chamberlain won 25–10 ; Born was so dejected that he gave up a promising NBA career and became a tractor engineer ( " If there were high school kids that good , I figured I was n't going to make it to the pros " ) , Cherry , 32–33 . 
87	and Auerbach wanted Chamberlain to go to a New England university , so he could draft him as a territorial pick for the Celtics , but Chamberlain did not respond . 
88	In Chamberlain 's third and final Overbrook season , he continued his high scoring , once logging 74 , 78 and 90 points in three consecutive games . 
89	Cherry , 34–35 . 
90	The Panthers won the Public League a third time , beating West Philadelphia 78–60 , and in the city championship game , they met West Catholic once again . 
91	Scoring 35 points , Chamberlain led Overbrook to an easy 83–42 victory . 
92	After 3 years , Chamberlain had won Overbrook 2 city championships , logged a 56–3 record and had broken Tom Gola 's high school scoring record by scoring 2,252 points , averaging 37.4 
93	points per game .

96	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 After his last Overbrook season , over 200 universities wanted to recruit the basketball prodigy . 
97	Among others , UCLA offered Chamberlain the opportunity to become a movie star , the University of Pennsylvania wanted to buy him diamonds , and Chamberlain 's Panthers coach Mosenson was even offered a coaching position if he could persuade the center . 
98	Cherry , 35–39 . 
99	Cherry has described that Chamberlain wanted a change and therefore did not want to go to or near Philadelphia ( also eliminating New York ) , was not interested in New England , and snubbed the South because of segregation ; leaving the Midwest . 
100	In the end , after visiting the University of Kansas , also commonly known as KU , with renowned college coach Phog Allen , Chamberlain then proclaimed he was going to play college basketball at KU. 
101	In 1955 , Chamberlain joined KU. 
102	Cherry described how shocked the young teenager was when he first arrived in the still-segregated city of Lawrence _ Kansas : after being treated like a star in his native Philadelphia , he now saw places black people were prohibited to enter . 
103	Chamberlain reacted by simply ignoring these signs , eating and going out wherever he wanted . 
104	Cherry , 43 . 
105	When he discovered that nobody heckled him , he gave up his antipathy , and as a result black people in Lawrence were eventually treated better . 
106	Chamberlain enjoyed living in Kansas , especially enjoying the rich jazz scene in nearby Kansas City . 
107	Cherry , 67 . 
108	At KU Chamberlain became a player for the Kansas Jayhawks freshman team under coach Phog Allen , whom he admired , and also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity , where he was the president of his pledge class . 
109	Cherry , 63 . 
110	Announced as "looking lighter than his 240 pounds , [able to ] reach 9'6 " up in the air [flatfooted] , and [with a wingspan of ] 7'2" , his debut was highly anticipated , and he delivered : in Chamberlain 's debut game for the freshman squad , the freshman Jayhawks were pitted against the varsity Jayhawks , who were favored to win their conference that year . 
111	Chamberlain dominated his older college mates by scoring 42 points ( 16–35 from the field , 10–12 on free throw ) , grabbing 29 rebounds and registering 4 blocks . 
112	Chamberlain 's prospects of playing under Allen ended , however , when the coach turned 70 shortly after and was forced to retire by KU regulation . 
113	Chamberlain had a bad relationship with Allen 's successor , Dick Harp , fueled by resentment and disappointment : Cherry has doubted whether Chamberlain would have chosen KU if he had known that Allen was going to retire . 
114	Cherry , 47 . 
115	On December 3 , 1956 , Chamberlain made his varsity debut . 
116	In his first varsity game the center scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds , breaking both all-time Kansas records in a 87–69 win against the Northwestern team of future NBA team mate Joe Ruklick . 
117	Cherry , 48–57. 
118	Teammate Monte Johnson testified to his athleticism : " Wilt ... 
119	had unbelievable endurance and speed ... 
120	and was never tired . 
121	When he dunked , he was so fast that a lot of players got their fingers jammed [between Chamberlain 's hand and the rim] . 
122	" Reportedly , Chamberlain also broke Johnny Kerr 's toe with a slam dunk . 
123	By this time , Chamberlain had developed several offensive weapons that became his trademarks : his finger roll , his fadeaway jump shot , which he could also hit as a bank shot , his passing and his shot-blocking . 
124	Leading a talented squad of starters , including Maurice King , Gene Elstun , John Parker , Ron Lonesky and Lew Johnson , the Jayhawks went 13–1 until they lost a game 56–54 versus Oklahoma State , who held the ball the last three and a half minutes without any intention of scoring a basket , which was still possible in the days before the shot clock ( introduced 1984 in the NCAA ) . 
125	As he did at Overbrook , Chamberlain again showcased his diverse athletic talent . 
126	He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9&nbsp;seconds 
127	, shot-putted 56&nbsp;feet , triple jump more than 50&nbsp;feet , and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years .

135	Biography - Wilt Chamberlain HickokSports .com 
136	September 6 , 2004 January 26 , 2008 In 1957 , 23 teams played for the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship . 
137	The Midwest regional tourney was held in Dallas _ Texas , which at the time was segregated . 
138	In the first game , the Jayhawks played the all-white Southern Methodist University team , and KU player John Parker later said : " The crowd was brutal . 
139	We were spat on , pelted with debris , and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible . 
140	" KU won 73–65 in overtime , after which police had to escort the Jayhawks out . 
141	The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant , with KU winning 81–61 under intense racist abuse . 
142	In the semi-finals , Chamberlain 's Jayhawks handily defeated the University of San Francisco , 80–56 , with Wilt scoring 32 points , grabbing 11 rebounds , and having at least 7 blocked shots . 
143	( Game film is unclear whether an 8th block occurred , or the ball just fell short due to Chamberlain ’s withering defensive intimidation ) . 
144	Chamberlain demonstrated his growing arsenal of offensive moves , including jump shots , put-backs , tip-ins , and his turnaround jump shot . 
145	He was far more comfortable and effective at the foul line than he would later be during his pro career . 
146	He had outstanding foot speed through out the game , and several times led the fastbreak , including blocking a shot near the basket and then outracing the field for a layup . 
147	His stellar performance lead Kansas to an insurmountable lead , and he rested on the bench for the final 3:45 remaining in the game . 
148	Chamberlain made the First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar Heels of North Carolina . 
149	In that game , Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain . 
150	For the tip-off , he sent his shortest player , Tommy Kearns , in order to rattle Chamberlain , and the Tar Heels spent the rest of the night triple-teaming him , one defender in front , one behind , and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball . 
151	With their fixation on Chamberlain , the Jayhawks shot only 27 % from the field , as opposed to 64 % of the Tar Heels , and trailed 22–29 at halftime . 
152	Later , North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game : they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket . 
153	After several Tar Heel turnovers , the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation . 
154	In the first overtime each teams scored 2 points , and in second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return , keeping the game tied at 48 . 
155	In the third overtime , the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets , but Chamberlain executed a three-point play , leaving KU trailing 52–51 . 
156	After King scored a basket , Kansas was ahead by one point , but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots . 
157	For the final play , Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post . 
158	The pass was too soft and was intercepted , however , and the Tar Heels won the game . 
159	Nonetheless , Chamberlain , who had scored 23 points and 14 rebounds , was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four . 
160	Cherry has speculated , however , that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain 's life , because it was the first time that his team had lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats . 
161	Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life . 
162	In Chamberlain 's junior year ( 1957–58 NCAA season ) , the Jayhawks ' matches were even more frustrating for him . 
163	Knowing how dominant Chamberlain was , the opponents resorted to freeze-ball tactics and routinely used three or more players to guard him . 
164	Cherry , 68–71 . 
165	Teammate Bob Billings commented : " It was not fun basketball ... 
166	we were just out chasing people throwing the basketball back and forth . 
167	" In addition Chamberlain grew weary of the punishment inflicted on him ; after a game against Missouri , he showed imprints of two rows of teeth marks in his arm . 
168	Nevertheless , Chamberlain averaged 30.1 
169	points for the season and led the Jayhawks to an 18–5 record , losing three games while he was out with a urinary infection : because KU came second in the league and at the time only conference winners were invited to the NCAA tourney , the Jayhawks ' season ended . 
170	It was a small consolation that he was again named an All- American , along with future NBA Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Oscar Robertson plus old rival Guy Rodgers . 
171	Having lost the enjoyment from NCAA basketball and wanting to earn money , he left college and sold the story named " Why I Am Leaving College " to Look magazine for $ 10,000 , a large sum when NBA players earned $ 9,000 in a whole season . 
172	In two seasons at Kansas , Chamberlain averaged 29.9 
173	points and 18.3 
174	rebounds per game while totaling 1,433 points and 877 rebounds , and led Kansas to one Big Seven championship . 
175	By the time Chamberlain was 21 , he had already been featured in Time , Life , Look , and Newsweek magazines , even before he turned professional .

178	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 For many years following Chamberlain 's departure from the University of Kansas , critics claimed that he either wanted to leave the very white Midwest or was embarrassed by not being able to bring home the NCAA basketball tournament victory . 
179	In 1998 , Chamberlain returned to Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence _ Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his # 13 . 
180	Around this time , he has been quoted as saying : " There 's been a lot of conversation , since people have been trying to get my jersey number retired , that I have some dislike for the University of Kansas . 
181	That is totally ridiculous .

202	Therefore , Chamberlain was prohibited from joining the NBA for a year , and decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $ 50,000 . 
203	Chamberlain became a member of the Globetrotters team which made history by playing in Moscow in 1959 , enjoyed a sold out tour of the USSR and prior to the start of a game at Moscow 's Lenin Central Stadium , were greeted by the General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev .

218	August 12 , 2007 yes One particular Trotter skit involved Trotters captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground , and instead of helping him up , Chamberlain threw him several feet high up in the air and caught him like a doll . 
219	" [ Chamberlain ] was the strongest athlete who ever lived " , the 210-pound Lemon recounted later . 
220	Cherry , 79 . 
221	In later years , Chamberlain frequently joined the Trotters in the off-season and fondly recalled his time there , because he was no longer jeered at or asked to break records , but just one of several artists who loved to entertain the crowd .

226	The Warriors ' draft pick was highly unusual , as it was a so-called " territorial pick " , despite Chamberlain 's having spent his college years in Kansas , which is not a region covered by Philadelphia ( or any other NBA team at the time ) . 
227	However , Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb , one of the NBA 's founding fathers , argued that Chamberlain had grown up in Philadelphia and had become popular there as a high school player , and that because there were no NBA teams in Kansas , the Warriors held his territorial rights and could draft him . 
228	The NBA agreed , marking the first time in NBA history that a player was made a territorial selection based on his pre-college roots . 
229	Chamberlain immediately became the NBA 's best paid player , earning $ 30,000 in his rookie contract ; in comparison , the previous top earner was Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics with $ 25,000 ; in fact , Gottlieb had bought the whole Warriors franchise for $ 25,000 seven years earlier . 
230	Cherry , 89 . 
231	In the 1959–60 NBA season , Chamberlain joined a Warriors squad that was coached by Neil Johnston and contained Hall-of-Fame guards Tom Gola and Paul Arizin , plus Ernie Beck and his old rival , Guy Rodgers ; remarkably , all five starters were Philadelphians . 
232	In his first NBA game , against the New York Knicks , the rookie center scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds . 
233	Cherry , 93–94 . 
234	In his fourth game , Philadelphia met the reigning champions , the Boston Celtics of Hall-of-Fame coach Red Auerbach , whose offer Chamberlain had snubbed several years before , and his old NCAA rival , Bill Russell , who was now lauded as one of the best defensive pivots in the game . 
235	In what was the first of many Chamberlain - Russell match-ups , Chamberlain outscored Russell with 30 points versus 28 points , but Boston won the game . 
236	Cherry called this outcome the first of many great duels between these pivots . 
237	Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis ( Russell ) would grow to become one of the NBA 's greatest on-court rivalries of all time . 
238	Nevertheless , the two also became friends off the court , similar to later rivals Magic Johnson and Larry Bird .

243	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 In his first NBA season , Chamberlain averaged 37.6 
244	points and 27 rebounds , convincingly breaking the previous regular-season records . 
245	He needed only 56 games to score # 2,102 , which broke the all-time regular season scoring record of Bob Pettit , who needed 72 games to score 2,101 points . 
246	Cherry , 96–97 . 
247	Chamberlain was named NBA MVP and Rookie of the Year that season , a feat matched only by fellow Hall-of-Famer Wes Unseld in the 1968–69 NBA season , and broke eight NBA records . 
248	Chamberlain capped off his rookie season by winning also the 1960 NBA All-Star Game MVP award with a 23-point , 25-rebound performance for the East . 
249	However , it also became evident that he was an atrocious free-throw shooter , making hardly half of his foul shots . 
250	As time progressed , Chamberlain grew even worse , and acknowledged he was simply a "psycho case " on that matter . 
251	The Warriors entered the 1960 NBA Playoffs and beat the Syracuse Nationals , setting up a meeting versus the Eastern Division champions , the Boston Celtics . 
252	Cherry described how Celtics coach Red Auerbach ordered his forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain : whenever the Warriors shot foul shots , Heinsohn grabbed and shoved Chamberlain to prevent him from running back quickly ; his intention was that the Celtics would throw the ball in so fast that the prolific shotblocker Chamberlain was not yet back under his own basket , and Boston could score an easy fastbreak basket . 
253	The teams split the first two games , but in Game 3 , Chamberlain got fed up with Heinsohn and punched him . 
254	In the scuffle , Wilt injured his hand , and Philadelphia lost the next two games . 
255	In Game 5 , with his hand back to normal , Chamberlain scored 50 points on Bill Russell . 
256	But in Game 6 , Heinsohn got the last laugh , scoring the decisive basket with a last-second tip-in . 
257	The Warriors lost the series 4-2 . 
258	The rookie Chamberlain then shocked Warriors ' fans by saying he was thinking of retiring . 
259	He was tired of being double- and triple-teamed , and of teams coming down on him with hard fouls . 
260	Chamberlain feared he might lose his cool one day . 
261	As Celtics forward Heinsohn said , himself no stranger to dirty play against Chamberlain : " Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... 
262	he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever " . 
263	In addition , Chamberlain was seen as a freak of nature , jeered at by the fans and scorned by the media . 
264	As Chamberlain often said , quoting coach Alex Hannum 's explanation of his situation , " Nobody loves Goliath . 
265	" Eddie Gottlieb coaxed Chamberlain back into the NBA , sweetening his return with a salary raise to $ 65,000 . 
266	Cherry , 99. 
267	The following season , Chamberlain surpassed his rookie season statistics as he averaged 38.4 
268	points per game and 27.2 
269	rebounds per game . 
270	He became the first player to break the 3,000-point barrier and the first and still only player to break the 2,000-rebound barrier for a single season , grabbing 2,149 boards .

287	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 Cherry noted that Chamberlain was "difficult " and did not respect coach Neil Johnston , who was unable to handle the star center . 
288	In retrospect , Eddie Gottlieb remarked : " My mistake was not getting a stronghanded coach .... 
289	[Johnston ] was n't ready for big time . 
290	" Cherry , 100 . 
291	In his third Warriors season , the team was coached by Frank McGuire , the coach who had masterminded Chamberlain 's painful NCAA loss against the Tar Heels . 
292	In that year , Wilt set several all-time records which have never been threatened . 
293	In the 1962 season , he averaged 50.4 
294	points and grabbed 25.7 
295	rebounds per game . 
296	Perhaps most astounding was , on March 2 , 1962 , in Hershey , Pennsylvania , Wilt 's scoring 100 points , shooting 36 of 63 from the field , and making 28 of 32 free throws against the New York Knicks . 
297	Chamberlain 's 4,029 regular-season points made him the first and only player to break the 4,000-point barrier . 
298	To put this in perspective , the only other player to break the 3,000-point barrier is Michael Jordan , with 3,041 points in the 1986 –87 NBA season . 
299	Chamberlain once again broke the 2,000-rebound barrier with 2,052 . 
300	Additionally , he was on the hardwood for an average of 48.53 
301	minutes , playing 3,882 of his team 's 3,890 minutes . 
302	Because Chamberlain played in overtime games , he averaged more minutes per game than the regulation 48 ; in fact , Chamberlain would have reached the 3,890-minute mark if he had not been ejected in one game after picking up a second technical foul with 8 minutes left to play . 
303	Cherry , 106 . 
304	His extraordinary feats in the 1962 season were later subject of the book Wilt , 1962 by Gary M. 
305	Pomerantz ( 2005 ) , who used Chamberlain as a metaphor for the uprising of Black America .

310	January 26 , 2008 In addition to Chamberlain 's regular-season accomplishments , he scored 42 points in the 1962 NBA All-Star Game , still the all-time record , on 17–23 shooting and pulled down 24 rebounds . 
311	In the 1962 NBA Playoffs , the Warriors met the Boston Celtics again in the Eastern Division Finals , a team which Bob Cousy and Bill Russell called the greatest Celtics team of all time . 
312	Cherry , 115–116 . 
313	Each team won their home games , so the series was split at 3 after six games . 
314	In a closely contested Game 7 , Chamberlain tied the game at 107 with 16 seconds to go , but Celtics shooting guard Sam Jones hit a clutch shot with 2 seconds left to win the series for Boston .

321	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 In later years , Chamberlain was criticized for averaging 50 points , but not winning a title . 
322	In his defense , Warriors coach Frank McGuire said " Wilt has been simply super-human" , and pointed out that the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer , a playmaker , and a second big man to take pressure off Chamberlain . 
323	Cherry , 105–106 . 
324	In the 1962–63 NBA season , Eddie Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $ 850,000 to a group of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco , and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach , Bob Feerick . 
325	Cherry , 118 . 
326	This also meant , however , that the team broke apart , as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia , and Tom Gola was homesick , requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season . 
327	Cherry , 125. 
328	With both secondary scorers gone , Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats , averaging 44.8 
329	points and 24.3 
330	rebounds per game that year . 
331	Despite his individual success , the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs .

338	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 In the 1963–64 NBA season , Chamberlain got yet another new coach , Alex Hannum , and was joined by a promising rookie center , Nate Thurmond , who eventually entered the Hall of Fame . 
339	Ex-soldier Hannum , who later entered the NBA Hall of Fame as a coach , was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing . 
340	Most importantly , he was not afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain , who was known to "freeze out " ( not communicate with ) coaches he did n't like . 
341	Cherry , 128 . 
342	Backed up by valuable rookie Thurmond , Chamberlain had another good season with 36.9 
343	ppg and 22.3 
344	rpg , and the Warriors went all the way to the NBA Finals . 
345	In that series they succumbed to Russell 's Boston Celtics yet again , this time losing 4–1 .

352	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 But as Cherry remarked , not only Chamberlain , but in particular Hannum deserved much credit because he had basically had taken the bad 31–49 squad of last year plus Thurmond and made it into a NBA Finalist . 
353	Cherry , 129 .

358	July 3 , 2009 made the acquaintance of a tall , talented 17-year old teenager who played there . 
359	Soon , the young Lew Alcindor was allowed into his inner circle , and quickly idolized the ten-year older NBA player . 
360	Unfortunately , Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , as Alcindor would name himself later , would develop an intensely personal antipathy . 
361	Cherry , 130–131 . 
362	In the following 1964–65 NBA season , the Warriors got off to a terrible start and ran into financial trouble . 
363	At the 1965 All-Star break Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers , the new name of the relocated Syracuse Nationals . 
364	In return the Warriors received Paul Neumann , Connie Dierking , Lee Shaffer ( who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors ) , and $ 150,000 . 
365	When Chamberlain left the Warriors , owner Franklin Mieuli said : " Chamberlain is not an easy man to love [and ] the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him . 
366	Wilt is easy to hate [ ...] 
367	people came to see him lose . 
368	" After the trade Chamberlain found himself on a promising Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer , a future Hall-of-Famer , and talented role players Larry Costello , Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson . 
369	Cherry remarks that there was a certain tension within the team : Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority , and Jackson , a talented center , was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot ; however , as the season progressed , the three began to mesh better . 
370	Cherry , 138–139 . 
371	Chamberlain did not care for the Sixer 's coach , Dolph Schayes , because Schayes , according to him , had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA . 
372	thumbChamberlain being defended byBill Russellof the Boston Celtics Statistically , Chamberlain was again outstanding , posting 34.7 
373	ppg and 22.9 
374	rpg for the second half of the season . 
375	After defeating the Cincinnati Royals led by Oscar Robertson in the 1965 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers met Chamberlain 's familiar rival , the Boston Celtics . 
376	The press called it an even matchup in all positions , even at center , where Bill Russell was expected to give Chamberlain a tough battle . 
377	Cherry , 141–143 . 
378	Indeed , the two teams split the first six games , and because of the better season record , the last game was held in the Celtics ' Boston Garden . 
379	In that Game 7 , both centers were marvelous : Chamberlain scored 30 points and 32 rebounds , and Russell logged 16 points , 27 rebounds and 8 assists . 
380	In the final minute , Chamberlain hit two clutch free throws and slam dunk on Russell , bringing Boston 's lead down to 110–109 with five seconds left . 
381	Russell botched the inbounds pass , hitting a guide wire over the backboard and giving the ball back to the Sixers . 
382	Coach Schayes called timeout , and decided to run the last play over Hal Greer rather than Chamberlain , because he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul him because he was a poor foul shooter . 
383	But when Greer attempted to inbound the ball , John Havlicek stole it to preserve the Celtics ' lead .

393	According to Chamberlain , that was the time that people started calling him "loser " . 
394	Additionally , in an April 1965 issue of Sports Illustrated Chamberlain conducted an interview entitled " My Life In A Bush League " where he criticized his fellow players , coaches , and NBA administrators .

401	February 15 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image . 
402	In the 1965–66 NBA season the Sixers experienced tragedy when Ike Richman , the Sixers ' co-owner as well as Chamberlain 's confidant and lawyer , died of a coronary . 
403	Still reeling from the shock , the Sixers posted a 55–25 regular season record , and for his strong play , Chamberlain was handed his second MVP award . 
404	In that season , the center again dominated his opposition by scoring 33.5 
405	points and 24.6 
406	rebounds a game , leading the league in both categories . 
407	In one particular game , Chamberlain blocked a dunk attempt by Gus Johnson so hard that he dislocated Johnson 's shoulder . 
408	Cherry , 161 . 
409	Off the court , however , Chamberlain 's commitment to the cause was doubted , as Chamberlain was a late sleeper , lived in New York and preferred to commute to Philadelphia rather than live there , and he was only available during the afternoon for training . 
410	Because Schayes did not want to risk angering his best player , he scheduled the daily workout at 4 pm ; this angered the team , who preferred an early schedule to have the afternoon off , but Schayes just said : " There is no other way . 
411	" Cherry , 160–161 . 
412	Irv Kosloff , who now owned the Sixers alone after Richman 's death , pleaded to him to move to Philadelphia during the season , but he was turned down . 
413	In the 1966 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers met their familiar foes , the Celtics , and for the first time even had home-court advantage . 
414	However , Boston easily won the first two games on the road , winning 115–96 and 114–93 ; Chamberlain played within his usual range , but his supporting cast shot under 40 % . 
415	This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment : " The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played . 
416	" Cherry , 163–165 . 
417	In Game 3 , Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for an important road win , and the next day , coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice . 
418	However , Chamberlain said he was " too tired " to attend , and even refused Schayes ' plea to at least show up and shoot a few foul shots with the team . 
419	In Game 4 , Boston won 114–108 . 
420	Prior to Game 5 , Chamberlain was nowhere to be found , skipping practice and being non-accessible . 
421	Outwardly , Schayes defended his star center as "excused from practice " , but his teammates knew the truth and were much less forgiving . 
422	In Game 5 itself , Chamberlain was superb , scoring 46 points and 34 rebounds , but the Celtics won the game 120–112 and the series .

429	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 Cherry is highly critical of Chamberlain : while conceding he was the only Sixers player who performed in the series , he pointed out his unprofessional , egotistical behavior as being a bad example for his teammates . 
430	Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season , the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face , the crafty but firm Alex Hannum . 
431	In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting , Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season , several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light . 
432	Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions , players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight . 
433	Cherry , 170–173 . 
434	Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum "never backed down " and " showed who was the boss " . 
435	By doing this , he won Chamberlain 's respect . 
436	When emotions cooled off , Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title ; but to pull this off , he – like his teammates – had to "act like a man " both on and off the court . 
437	Concerning basketball , he persuaded him to change his style of play . 
438	Loaded with several other players who could score , such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham , Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense .

441	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 As a result , Chamberlain was less dominant , taking only 14 % of the team 's shots ( in his 50.4 
442	ppg season , it was 35.3 
443	% ) , but extremely efficient : he averaged a career-low 24.1 
444	points , but he led the league in rebounds ( 24.2 
445	) , ended third in assists ( 7.8 
446	) , had a record breaking .683 
447	field goal accuracy , and played strong defense . 
448	For these feats , Chamberlain earned his third MVP award . 
449	The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68–13 season , including a record 46–4 start . 
450	In addition , the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates , lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the "ultimate power forward " , calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter , and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer . 
451	Off the court , the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill , knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others . 
452	Greer , who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude , spoke positively of the new Chamberlain : " You knew in a minute the Big Fella [ Chamberlain ] was ready to go ... 
453	and everybody would follow . 
454	" thumbChamberlain andNate Thurmondof theGolden State WarriorsSan Francisco Warriorsbattle for the basketball . 
455	In the 1967 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers yet again battled the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals , and again held home court advantage . 
456	In Game 1 , the Sixers beat Boston 127–112 , powered by Hal Greer 's 39 points and Chamberlain 's unofficial quadruple double , with 24 points , 32 rebounds , 13 assists and (unofficially counted ) 12 blocks . 
457	Cherry , 173–179 . 
458	In Game 2 , the Sixers won 107–102 in overtime , and player-coach Russell grudgingly praised Chamberlain for intimidating the Celtics into taking low percentage shots from further outside . 
459	In Game 3 , Chamberlain grabbed 41 rebounds and helped the Sixers win 115–104 . 
460	The Celtics prevented a sweep by winning Game 4 with a 121–117 victory , but in Game 5 , the Sixers simply overpowered the Celtics 140–116 , which effectively ended Boston 's historic run of 8 consecutive NBA titles . 
461	The Sixers ' center scored 29 points , 36 rebounds and 13 assists and was highly praised by Celtics Russell and K.C. 
462	Jones . 
463	In the 1967 NBA Finals , the Sixers were pitted against Chamberlain 's old team , the San Francisco Warriors of his one-time backup Nate Thurmond and star forward Rick Barry . 
464	The Sixers won the first two games , with Chamberlain and Greer taking credit for respectively defensive dominance and clutch shooting , but San Francisco won two of the next three games , so Philadelphia was up 3–2 prior to Game 6 . 
465	In Game 6 , the Warriors were trailing 123-122 with 15 seconds left . 
466	For the last play , Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and whoever would guard Barry . 
467	However , the Sixers foiled it : when Barry ran past Thurmond 's pick and drove to the basket , he was picked up by Chet Walker , making it impossible to shoot ; Thurmond was covered by Chamberlain , which made it impossible to pass . 
468	Barry botched his shot attempt , and the Sixers won the championship . 
469	Chamberlain said : " It is a wonderful to be a part of the greatest team in basketball ... 
470	being a champion is like having a big round glow inside of you .

478	1967 NBA Season Summary http ://www.basketball-reference 
479	.com/leagues/NBA_1967.html 
480	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 Chamberlain himself described the team as the best in NBA history . 
481	In 2002 , writer Wayne Lynch wrote a book about this remarkable Sixers season , Season of the 76ers , centering on Chamberlain . 
482	In the 1967–68 NBA season , matters began to turn sour between Chamberlain and the Sixers ' sole surviving owner , Irv Kosloff . 
483	This conflict had been going along for a while : in 1965 , Chamberlain asserted that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give the center 25 % of the franchise once he had ended his career . 
484	Cherry , 185–187 . 
485	Although there is no written proof for or against , ex-Sixers coach Dolph Schayes and Sixers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was right ; in any case , Kosloff declined the request , leaving Chamberlain livid and willing to jump to the rival ABA once his contract ended in 1967 . 
486	Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce , and later signed a one-year , $ 250,000 contract . 
487	On the hardwood , Chamberlain continued his focus on team play and registered 24.3 
488	points and 23.8 
489	rebounds a game for the season . 
490	The 76ers had the best record in the league for the third straight season . 
491	Chamberlain made history by becoming the first and only center in NBA history to finish the season as the leader in assists , his 702 beating runner-up , Hall-of-Fame point guard Lenny Wilkens ' total by 23 . 
492	For these feats , Chamberlain won his fourth and last MVP title . 
493	Another landmark was his 25,000th point , making him the first ever player to score these many points : he gave the ball to his team physician Dr. 
494	Stan Lorber . 
495	Cherry , 188 . 
496	Winning 62 games , the Sixers easily took the first playoff berth of the 1968 NBA Playoffs . 
497	In the 1968 Eastern Division Semifinals , they were pitted against the Knicks . 
498	In a physically tough matchup , the Sixers lost sixth man Billy Cunningham with a broken hand , and Chamberlain , Greer and Jackson were struggling with inflamed feet , bad knees , and pulled hamstrings respectively . 
499	Going ahead 3–2 , the Sixers defeated the Knicks 115–97 in Game 6 after Chamberlain scored 25 points and 27 rebounds : he had a successful series in which he led both teams in points ( 153 ) , rebounds ( 145 ) and assists ( 38 ) . 
500	Cherry , 189 . 
501	In the 1968 Eastern Division Finals , the Sixers yet again met the Boston Celtics , again with home court advantage , and this time as reigning champions . 
502	Despite the Sixers ' injury woes , coach Hannum was confident to "take the Celtics in less than seven games " : he pointed out the age of the Celtics , who were built around Bill Russell and guard Sam Jones , both 34. 
503	Cherry , 190–199 . 
504	But then , national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4 , 1968 . 
505	With eight of the ten starting players on the Sixers and Celtics being African- American , both teams were in deep shock , and there were calls to cancel the series . 
506	In a game called "unreal " and "devoid of emotion" , the Sixers lost 127–118 on April 5 . 
507	After attending Dr. 
508	King 's funeral , Chamberlain called out to the angry rioters who were setting fires all over the country , stating Dr. 
509	King would not have approved . 
510	In Game 2 , Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 victory , and won Games 3 and 4 , with Chamberlain suspiciously often played by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry , causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down . 
511	Prior to Game 5 , the Celtics seemed dead : no NBA team had overcome a 3–1 series deficit before . 
512	However , the Celtics rallied back , winning Games 5 and 6 122–104 and 114–106 respectively , powered by a spirited John Havlicek and helped by the Sixers ' terrible shooting . 
513	What followed was the first of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played . 
514	In that Game 7 , the Sixers could not get their act together : 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat , making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3 games to 1 . 
515	Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly ( Hal Greer , Wali Jones , Chet Walker , Luke Jackson and Matt Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots ) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9 , the center himself scored only 14 points . 
516	In the second half of Game 7 , Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field . 
517	Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game : in a typical Sixers game , Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post , but only 23 times in Game 7 , and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter . 
518	Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches ( i .e 
519	. 
520	scoring opportunities ) , a point which the coach conceded himself , but Cherry points out that Chamberlain , who always thought of himself as the best player of all time , should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself . 
521	The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1–6 in playoff series against the Celtics . 
522	After that season , coach Alex Hannum wanted to be closer to his family on the West Coast ; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association . 
523	Cherry , 203 . 
524	Chamberlain then asked for a trade , and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff , Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers . 
525	The motivation for this move remains in dispute . 
526	According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby , a journalist close to the Lakers , Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman- Chamberlain deal , but according to Dr. 
527	Jack Ramsay , who was the Sixers general manager then , Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left , and forced the trade himself . 
528	Cherry finally adds several personal reasons : the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia , sought the presence of fellow celebrities ( which were plenty in L.A. 
529	) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women , which was possible for a black man in L.A. 
530	but hard to imagine elsewhere back then . 
531	Cherry , 205 . 
532	On July 9 , 1968 , Chamberlain was the centerpiece of a major trade between the 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers , who sent center Darrall Imhoff ( the unfortunate ex - Knicks center who started against Chamberlain when the latter scored 100 points ) , forward Jerry Chambers and guard Archie Clark to Philadelphia , making it the first time a reigning NBA Most Valuable Player was traded the next season . 
533	Cherry , 206 . 
534	Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract , paying him $ 250,000 after taxes ; in comparison , previous Laker top earner Jerry West was paid $ 100,000 before taxes . 
535	Cherry , 213–215 . 
536	Chamberlain joined a squad which featured Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor and Hall-of-Fame guard Jerry West , along with backup center Mel Counts , forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins and talented but diminutive 5'11 " guard Johnny Egan . 
537	The lack of a second guard next to West ( and thus , the lack of speed and quickness ) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff ; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich , who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft , he said : " Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [lack of ] size ...but 
538	if I do n't play him , we look like a bunch of trucks . 
539	" Cherry , 216–222 . 
540	In addition , Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower , which made him difficult to fit in . 
541	While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West , he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor ; regarding Baylor , he later explained : " We were good friends , but ... 
542	[in ] black culture ... 
543	you never let the other guy one-up you . 
544	" The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff : pejoratively calling the new recruit " The Load" , he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical , never respected him , too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics . 
545	In return , the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as " the dumbest and worst coach ever " . 
546	Laker Keith Erickson observed that " Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry ...and 
547	that is not a good way to get on Wilt 's side ...that 
548	relationship was doomed from the start . 
549	" Chamberlain experienced a problematic and often frustrating season . 
550	Van Breda Kolff benched him several times , which never happened in his career before ; in mid-season , the perennial scoring champion had two games in which he scored only six and then only 2 points . 
551	Playing through his problems , Chamberlain averaged 20.5 
552	points and 21.1 
553	rebounds a game that season . 
554	However , Jack Kent Cooke was pleased , because since acquiring Chamberlain , ticket sales went up by 11 % . 
555	In the 1969 NBA Playoffs , the Lakers dispatched Chamberlain 's old club , the San Francisco Warriors 4–2 after losing the first two games , and then defeated the Atlanta Hawks and met Chamberlain 's familiar rivals , Bill Russell 's Boston Celtics . 
556	Going into the series as 3-to-1 favorites , the Lakers won the first two games , but dropped the next two . 
557	Chamberlain was criticized as a non-factor in the series , getting neutralized by Bill Russell with little effort . 
558	But in Game 5 , the Lakers center started to come to life , scoring 13 points and grabbing 31 rebounds , leading Los Angeles to a 117–104 win . 
559	In Game 6 , the Celtics won 99–90 , and Chamberlain only scored 8 points ; Cherry accuses him of choking , because if " Chamberlain had came up big and put up a normal 30 point scoring night " , L.A. 
560	would have probably won its first championship . 
561	Game 7 featured a surreal scene : in anticipation of a Lakers win , Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles . 
562	This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered Jerry West . 
563	In that match , Chamberlain experienced his second Game 7 debacle . 
564	The Lakers trailed 91-76 after three quarters . 
565	But powered by a limping Jerry West , who played with a deep thigh bruise after Game 5 , the Lakers mounted a comeback ; but then Chamberlain twisted his knee after a rebound and had to be replaced by Mel Counts . 
566	With three minutes to go , and West and Counts hitting clutch baskets , the Lakers trailed 103-102 . 
567	But when the Celtics tightened up their defense , the Lakers committed costly turnovers and lost the game 108–106 , despite a triple-double from West , who had 42 points , 13 rebounds and 12 assists . 
568	West became the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team . 
569	After the game , the key question was why Chamberlain had stayed out the final six minutes . 
570	At the time of his final substitution , he had scored 18 points ( hitting 7 of his 8 shots ) and grabbed 27 rebounds , significantly better than the 10 points of Mel Counts on 4-of-13 shooting . 
571	To justify a late minute sub , either Chamberlain 's injury had to be grave , or Van Breda Kolff 's trust in Counts absolute . 
572	Among others , Bill Russell did n't believe Chamberlain 's injury was grave , and openly accused him of being a malingerer : " Any injury short of a broken leg or a broken back is not enough . 
573	" Ironically , Van Breda Kolff came to Chamberlain 's defense , insisting the often-maligned Lakers center hardly was able to move in the end . 
574	He himself was perceived as "pig-headed " for benching Chamberlain , and soon resigned as Lakers coach . 
575	Cherry comments that according to some journalists , that Game 7 "destroyed two careers : Wilt 's because he would n't take over and Van Breda Kolff because he would n't give in" . 
576	In his second year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney , Chamberlain seriously injured his knee . 
577	He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season . 
578	Owing to a great start , he managed to average 27.3 
579	points , 18.4 
580	rebounds and 4.1 
581	assists per game . 
582	Again , the Lakers charged through the playoffs , and in the 1970 NBA Finals , the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks , loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed , Dave DeBusschere , Bill Bradley , and Walt Frazier . 
583	Cherry observed that Reed , a prolific midrange shooter , was a bad matchup for Chamberlain : having lost lateral quickness due to his injury , the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed 's preferred high post jump shots . 
584	Cherry , 231–239 . 
585	In Game 1 , Reed masterminded a 124–112 win in which he scored 37 points on Chamberlain . 
586	In Game 2 , Chamberlain scored 19 points , grabbed 24 rebounds and blocked Reed 's shot in the final seconds , leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win . 
587	Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102 ; however , the Knicks took the game 111–108 . 
588	In Game 4 , Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2. 
589	But in Game 5 , things seemed to go awry for the Knicks : trailing by double digits , Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series . 
590	By conventional wisdom , Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere , who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center . 
591	Instead , the Lakers gave away their 13 point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense : L.A. 
592	committed 19 second half turnovers , and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times , respectively , in the entire second half . 
593	The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history . 
594	In Game 6 , Chamberlain scored 45 points and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win , and with Reed out , the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York . 
595	However , the hero of that Game 7 was Willis Reed . 
596	He famously hobbled up court , scored the first four points , and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time .

601	February 10 , 2007 January 27 , 2008 The Knicks led by 27 at halftime , and despite scoring 21 points , Chamberlain could n't prevent a third consecutive loss in a Game 7 . 
602	The Lakers center himself was criticized for his inability to dominate his injured counterpart , but Cherry pointed out that Chamberlain 's feat – coming back from career-threatening injury himself – was too quickly forgotten . 
603	In the 1970–71 NBA season , the Lakers made a notable move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich , who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. 
604	until 1968 . 
605	Chamberlain averaged 20.7 
606	points , 18.2 
607	rebounds and 4.3 
608	assists , once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title . 
609	After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career , and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury , the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor , better known under his later Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals . 
610	Winning the regular season with 66 wins , the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers ; still , many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year old Chamberlain and the 24-year old Alcindor . 
611	Cherry , 246–247 . 
612	In Game 1 , Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22 , and the Bucks won 106–85 . 
613	In Game 2 , the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points , four more than his Milwaukee counterpart . 
614	Prior to Game 3 , things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson , West 's stand-in , had an appendectomy and was out for the season ; with only rookie Jim McMillan easing the scoring pressure , Chamberlain scored 24 points and 24 rebounds in a 118-107 victory , but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117-94 in Game 4 to take a 3-1 series lead . 
615	Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5 .

622	February 10 , 2007 January 27 , 2008 Although Chamberlain lost , he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor , who was not only 10 years younger , but still had two healthy knees . 
623	After the 1971 playoffs , Chamberlain had an offer to fight heavyweight boxing legend Muhammad Ali . 
624	The 15-round fight would have taken place on July 26 , 1971 in the Houston Astrodome but Chamberlain finally refused the match . 
625	In an 1999 interview , Chamberlain stated that boxing trainer Cus D'Amato wanted to train him for the fight , and they offered Ali and him $ 5 million each to battle each other . 
626	However , after checking back with his father , Chamberlain finally said no .

640	Sharman introduced morning shoot-arounds , in which the perennial latecomer Chamberlain regularly participated ( in contrast to earlier years with Dolph Schayes ) and transformed him into a defensive-minded , low-scoring post defender in the mold of his old rival Bill Russell .

643	February 10 , 2007 January 27 , 2008 Furthermore , he told Chamberlain to use his rebounding and passing skills to quickly initiate fastbreak to his teammates , forwards Happy Hairston and MacMillian , guards Goodrich and West , and bench players Flynn Robinson and LeRoy Ellis . 
644	Cherry , 255 . 
645	While no longer being the main scorer , Chamberlain was named the new captain of the Lakers : after rupturing his Achilles tendon , perennial captain Elgin Baylor retired , leaving a void the center now filled . 
646	Initially , Sharman had wanted Chamberlain and West to share this duty , but West declined , stating he was injury-prone and wanted to solely concentrate on the game . 
647	Cherry , 257. 
648	Chamberlain accepted his new roles and posted an all-time low 14.8 
649	points , but also won the rebound crown with 19.2 
650	rpg and led the league with a .649 
651	field goal percentage . 
652	Powered by his defensive presence , the Lakers embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season .

660	The matchup between Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar was hailed by LIFE magazine as the greatest matchup in all of sports . 
661	Chamberlain would help lead the Lakers past Jabbar and the Bucks in 6 games . 
662	Particularly , Chamberlain was lauded for his performance in Game 6 , which the Lakers won 106–100 after trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter : he scored 24 points and 22 rebounds , played all 48 minutes and outsprinted the younger Bucks center on several late Lakers fast breaks . 
663	Cherry , 264–265 . 
664	Jerry West called it " the greatest ball-busting performance I have ever seen .

673	May 22 , 1972 January 27 , 2008 Time In the 1972 NBA Finals , the Lakers again met the New York Knicks ; the Knicks were shorthanded after losing Willis Reed to injury , and so , undersized 6'8 " Jerry Lucas had the task to defend against the 7'1 " Chamberlain . 
674	Cherry , 266–270 . 
675	However , prolific outside shooter Lucas helped New York to win Game 1 , hitting 9 of his 11 shots in the first half alone ; in Game 2 , which the Lakers won 106–92 , Chamberlain put Lucas into foul trouble , and the Knicks lost defensive power forward Dave DeBusschere to injury . 
676	In Game 3 , Chamberlain scored 26 points and grabbed 20 rebounds for another Lakers win , and in a fiercely battled Game 4 , the Lakers center was playing with five fouls late in the game . 
677	Having never fouled out in his career – a feat that he was very proud of – he played aggressive defense despite the risk of fouling out , and blocked two of Lucas ' shots in overtime , proving those wrong who said he only played for his own stats ; he ended scoring a game-high 27 points . 
678	But in that game , he had fallen on his right hand , and was said to have " sprained " it ; it was actually broken . 
679	For Game 5 , Chamberlain 's hands were packed into thick pads normally destined for defensive linesmen in American Football ; he was offered a painkilling shot , but refused because he feared he would lose his shooting touch if his hands became numb . 
680	In Game 5 , Chamberlain recorded 24 points , 29 rebounds , 8 assists and 8 blocked shots . 
681	( While blocked shots were not an official NBA stat at that time , announcer Keith Jackson counted the blocks during the broadcast . 
682	August 2011 ) Chamberlain 's outstanding all-around performance helped the Lakers win their first championship with a decisive 114–100 win . 
683	Chamberlain was named Finals MVP , and was admired for dominating the Knicks in Game 5 while playing injured . 
684	The 1972–73 NBA season was to be Chamberlain 's last , although he did n't know this at the time . 
685	In his last season , the Lakers had lost substance : Happy Hairston was injured , Flynn Robinson and LeRoy Ellis had left , and veteran Jerry West struggled with sensitive hamstrings . 
686	Cherry , 290 . 
687	Chamberlain averaged 13.2 
688	points and 18.6 
689	rebounds , still enough to win the rebounding crown for the 11th time in his career . 
690	In addition , he shot an NBA record .727 
691	% for the season , bettering his own mark of .683 
692	from the 1966–67 season — neither percentage has been topped by any other player . 
693	It was the ninth time Chamberlain would lead the league in field goal percentage . 
694	The Lakers won 60 games in the regular season and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks . 
695	This time , the tables were turned : the Knicks now featured a healthy team with a rejuvenated Willis Reed , and the Lakers were now handicapped by several injuries . 
696	In that series , the Lakers won Game 1 115–112 , but the Knicks won Games 2 and 3 ; things worsened when Jerry West injured his hamstring yet again . 
697	In Game 4 , the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York , and in Game 5 , the valiant , but injured West and Hairston had miserable games , and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds , the Lakers lost 102–93 and the series .

705	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 Chamberlain did not yet know that this loss was the last professional game of his career . 
706	In 1973 , the San Diego Conquistadors of the NBA rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $ 600,000 salary . 
707	Cherry , 294–299 . 
708	However , the Lakers sued their former star and successfully prevented him from actually playing , because he still owed them the option year of his contract . 
709	Barred from playing , Chamberlain mostly left the coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck , who recalled : " Chamberlain ... 
710	has a great feel for pro basketball ... 
711	[but ] the day-to-day things that are an important part of basketball ... 
712	just bored him . 
713	He did not have the patience . 
714	" The players were split on Chamberlain , who was seen as competent , but often indifferent and more occupied with promotion of his autobiography Wilt : Just Like Any Other 7- Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door than with coaching . 
715	In his single season as a coach , the " Qs" , as the Conquistadors were colloquially called , went a mediocre 37–47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the Division Semifinals . 
716	However , Chamberlain was not pleased by the meagre Qs ' attendance : the crowd was an average 1,843 , hardly filling half of the Qs ' small San Diego 3,200-seat sports arena . 
717	After the season , Chamberlain retired from professional basketball . 
718	After his stint with the Qs , Chamberlain successfully went into business and entertainment , made money in stocks and real estate , opened a popular Harlem nightclub , Big Wilt 's Smalls Paradise , and invested in broodmare . 
719	Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams , and also provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball , track , volleyball and softball , Ostler Scott WILT : The Ultimate All-Star http ://www.nba.com/warriors/history/Ostler_chamberlain

723	March 16 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 and made money by appearing in ads for TWA , American Express , Volkswagen , Drexel Burnham , Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker . 
724	After his basketball career , volleyball became Chamberlain 's new passion : being a talented hobby volleyballer ( albeit due to lack of technique , not as excellent as volleyball All- American Lakers team mate Keith Erickson ) during his Lakers days , he became board member of the newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later . 
725	Cherry , 311–316 . 
726	As a testament to his importance , the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it : he rose to the challenge and was named the game 's MVP . 
727	He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979 . 
728	However , Chamberlain had promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame : he became one of the few athletes who were enshrined in different sports . 
729	In addition , Chamberlain played a villainous warrior and counterpart of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film Conan the Destroyer ( 1984 ) , where his most remarkable spoken phrase is " thieves should be hanged " : This caused his physician , Dr. 
730	Lorber , to jokingly greet Chamberlain with " thieves should be hanged " whenever they met . 
731	Cherry , 328 . 
732	When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA , Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career . 
733	Cherry , 330 . 
734	A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who 's Running the Asylum ? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today ( 1997 ) , in which he harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past .

740	February 10 , 2007 January 26 , 2008 and even in the 1980s , he flirted with making a comeback in the NBA . 
741	In the 1980–81 NBA season , coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers . 
742	When Chamberlain was 50 , the New Jersey Nets had the same idea , and Chamberlain declined again . 
743	However , he would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come , including participating in several marathons .

776	2007-02-10 Chamberlain 's main weakness was his notoriously poor free throw shooting , where he has the third lowest career free throw percentage in NBA history with 51.1 
777	% ( based on a minimum of 1,200 attempts ) . 
778	He later acknowledged that he was a "psycho case " in this matter . 
779	On the other hand , he committed surprisingly few fouls during his NBA career , despite the rugged play in the post . 
780	Chamberlain never fouled out of a regular season or playoff game in his 14-year NBA career . 
781	His career average was only 2 fouls per game , despite having averaged 45.8 
782	minutes per game over his career . 
783	He had 5 seasons where he committed less than 2 fouls per game , with a career low of 1.5 
784	fouls during the 1962 season , in which he also averaged 50.4 
785	points per game . 
786	His fouls per 36 minutes ( a stat used to compare players that average vastly different minutes ) was a remarkable 1.6 
787	per game . 
788	For his feats , Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978 , named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History , ranked # 2 in SLAM Magazine s Top 50 NBA Players of All-Time http ://www .slamonline

802	In political philosophy , Chamberlain is known for the so-called " Wilt Chamberlain Argument . 
803	" Libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick states that if fans agreed to pay to see him play , then Chamberlain was entitled to a greater amount of resources because the inequality would have resulted from a free exchange of resources . 
804	Nozick used Chamberlain as a real-life example to argue that non-entitlement theories of justice were inherently unjust .
