2	The Boston Celtics , top-seeded champions of the Eastern Conference , defeated the Los Angeles Lakers , top-seeded champions of the Western Conference , four games to two in a best-of-seven series . 
3	This was Boston 's first title since 1986 and 17th overall . 
4	2008 marked the first time since 2000 that the top seeds from both conferences met in the Finals and the first time since 2003 that any top seeded team played in the NBA finals . 
5	The Lakers appeared in the Finals for the first time since 2004 and a record 29th time overall . 
6	The Celtics appeared in the Finals for the first time since 1987 and second-best 20th time overall . 
7	Going into the series , the Celtics had won the most championships all-time with 16 , and the Lakers were second with 14 . 
8	The two clubs , the most successful teams in NBA history , looked to renew a longstanding rivalry 21 years after their last Finals meeting in 1987 . 
9	They narrowly missed meeting each other in 2002 , when the Lakers advanced to the Finals , but the Celtics , who led 2-1 in the Conference Finals , eventually fell to the favored New Jersey Nets 4-2 . 
10	This was the 11th time the teams met in the championship round ; the Celtics won eight of their previous ten Finals meetings against the Lakers , winning in 1959 , 1962 , 1963 , 1965 , 1966 , 1968 , 1969 and 1984 —the Lakers won in 1985 and 1987 . 
11	The Celtics ' 66–16 record gave them home court advantage over Los Angeles ( 57–25 ) . 
12	This was the first time since 1997 , when the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz for the championship , and the only time in the 2000s decade that an Eastern Conference team had the home court advantage and the first Finals since 1998 not to feature either Tim Duncan or Shaquille O'Neal . 
13	Rodd Houston narrated the Boston Celtics ' championship season documentary on NBA Entertainment . 
14	The made-for-TV version of this documentary is narrated by Kevin Harlan . 
15	The Celtics were making their first NBA Finals appearance since a six-game loss to the Lakers in 1987 . 
16	Over the next 20 years the Celtics would suffer through several lean years , not making the playoffs in nine of those years . 
17	Following the departures of Larry Bird and Kevin McHale the Celtics suffered through several tragedies such as the passing of Reggie Lewis in 1993 , a franchise-worst 15-win 1996–97 season , the ill-fated hiring of head coach Rick Pitino , and the deaths of franchise patriarch Red Auerbach and former player Dennis Johnson that culminated in a 24-win 2006–07 season , highlighted by a franchise-worst 18 straight losses . 
18	But hope was on the horizon . 
19	The 2007 off-season saw Celtics GM Danny Ainge acquire Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett to join franchise star Paul Pierce . 
20	The newly-formed ' Big Three ' led the Celtics to a dramatic 42-game turnaround , finishing with 66 wins . 
21	In the playoffs the Celtics were pushed to the brink by the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers , and despite not winning on the road , they managed to prevail in a pair of Game 7s at their home court . 
22	The Celtics would finally break their road woes in a six-game win against the perennial Eastern Conference powerhouse Detroit Pistons , earning their first finals berth since 1987 . 
23	After losing to the Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals despite a talent-laden roster , Phil Jackson abruptly retired . 
24	Soon after the Lakers decided to rebuild by trading away Shaquille O'Neal . 
25	The 2004–05 season saw the Lakers miss the playoffs for only the fifth time in team history . 
26	Even though he had written a book called The Last Season , going as far as calling Kobe Bryant "uncoachable" , Jackson returned to the Lakers for the 2005–06 season . 
27	Jackson and Bryant would patch their differences , but after a pair of first-round exits , Bryant demanded , but later retracted , a trade in the off-season . 
28	The Lakers ' 2007-08 season saw the team win 57 games , along the way adding Spanish forward Pau Gasol in mid-season while Andrew Bynum was recovering from a mid-season knee injury . 
29	The Lakers eliminated the Denver Nuggets 4-0 , then the Utah Jazz 4-2 and then dethroned the erstwhile defending champion San Antonio Spurs 4-1 in the conference finals , making their 29th NBA Finals appearance .

53	He soon hit two three-pointers on consecutive offensive possessions that gave Boston the lead for good and finished with 22 points . 
54	The Lakers , who had had home court advantage throughout the first three rounds and had not trailed a series in that same time , now had to do without both luxuries for the first time .

145	June 18 , 2008 Boston Globe 2008-06-18 This was the Celtics ' 17th championship , their first since 1986 , extending their record for most NBA championships won by a single team . 
146	All this capped off the Celtics ' best regular season ( 66-16 ) since their previous championship season in which they went 67-15 . 
147	It was also a sense of relief , as the Celtics set an NBA record for most playoff games ever needed to win a championship , with 26 , surpassing the previous record of 24 by the Lakers in 1988 . 
148	The Celtics ' win was also seen as an addition to the recent success of Boston-area sports teams , following the wins by the New England Patriots in Super Bowls XXXVI , XXXVIII , and XXXIX ( 2001 , 2003 and 2004 seasons ) and the Red Sox 's World Series wins in 2004 ( death of the Curse of the Bambino ) and 2007 . 
149	The Celtics won this series by winning Games 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 ; coincidentally , the last time the two teams met in 1987 , the Lakers won that series in identical fashion .

264	2008-03-04 Aside from ABC ( U.S. 
265	) and TSN ( Canada ) , other broadcasters across the world covered the Finals : , NBA.com 
266	In the 2008-09 season the Celtics raced to a 27-2 start , the best through 29 games in NBA history , until that fateful finals rematch against the Lakers on Christmas Day ended a franchise-high 19-game winning streak . 
267	Then days after the All-Star Game Kevin Garnett injured his right knee , and was lost for the season . 
268	The Celtics won 62 games , but the absence of Garnett affected the team as they were eliminated in seven games by the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Semifinals . 
269	The Lakers rebounded to win 65 games in the aforementioned season , then proceeded to win the NBA title in five games over the Magic . 
270	Even though another mid-season injury to Andrew Bynum threatened their title drive , he did come back late in the season . 
271	The Lakers became the first team since the 1988-89 Pistons to win the NBA Finals after losing it in the previous year . 
272	Both teams would eventually meet again in 2010 where the Lakers defeated the Celtics in seven games . 
273	The Celtics ' 17th championship raised the total of major professional sports championships in Boston to 32 , and it continued a string of championships for the city this decade . 
274	The NFL 's New England Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2001 , 2003 and 2004 , and nearly won a fourth on Super Bowl XLII , only to have a perfect season denied by the New York Giants five months earlier . 
275	Major League Baseball 's Boston Red Sox won the their second World Series title of the decade nine months earlier , adding their total to seven . 
276	With the NHL 's Boston Bruins winning the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals , the city of Boston became the first city to win championships in all four major sports in a seven-year span . 
277	The city 's total title tally now stands at 33 .
