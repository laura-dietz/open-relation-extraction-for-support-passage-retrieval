30	History of Basketball in Canada NBA Media Ventures , LLC 2007-04-13 Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues , including the American Basketball League and the NBL , the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities . 
31	During its early years , the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters . 
32	For instance , the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league 's 1948 title , and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title . 
33	On August 3 , 1949 , the BAA agreed to merge with the NBL , creating the new National Basketball Association .

38	NBA is born History July 29 , 2010 The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities , as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories . 
39	In 1950 , the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises , a process that continued until 1953–54 , when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises , all of which are still in the league ( the Knicks , Celtics , Warriors , Lakers , Royals/Kings , Pistons , Hawks , and Nationals/76ers ) . 
40	The process of contraction saw the league 's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities . 
41	The Hawks shifted from " Tri-Cities " ( the area now known as the Quad Cities ) to Milwaukee ( in 1951 ) and then to St . 
42	Louis ( in 1955 ) ; the Royals from Rochester to Cincinnati ( in 1957 ) ; and the Pistons from Fort Wayne to Detroit ( in 1957 ) . 
43	Although Japanese-American Wataru Misaka technically broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks , 1950 is recognized as the year the NBA integrated . 
44	This year witnessed the addition of African American players by several teams , including Chuck Cooper with the Boston Celtics , Nat " Sweetwater " Clifton with the New York Knicks , and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols . 
45	During this period , the Minneapolis Lakers , led by center George Mikan , won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league 's first dynasty .

82	It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based on a photo by Wen Roberts , although NBA officials have denied a particular player as being its influence because , according to Siegel , " They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it . 
83	It 's become such a ubiquitous , classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they do n't necessarily want to identify it with one player . 
84	" The iconic logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand .

233	Donaghy alleged that refs influenced the outcome of certain playoff and final games in 2002 and 2005 . 
234	NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a " singing , cooperating witness " .

267	2012-01-05 The 2011–12 NBA season , scheduled to begin November 1 , 2011 with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls , was postponed due to a labor dispute . 
268	The lockout officially ended on December 8 , 2011 , when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement , and the season began on Christmas Day . 
269	List of defunct National Basketball Association teams The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams , and through a sequence of team expansions , reductions , and relocations currently consists of 30 teams . 
270	The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada . 
271	The Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins . 
272	The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers , who have 16 overall championships ( 11 in Los Angeles _ 5 in Minneapolis ) . 
273	Following the Lakers are the Chicago Bulls with six championships , all of them over an 8-year span during the 1990s , and the San Antonio Spurs with four championships , all since 1999 . 
274	The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each . 
275	The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season . 
276	An asterisk ( * ) denotes a franchise move . 
277	See the respective team articles for more information . 
278	The Fort Wayne Pistons , Minneapolis Lakers and Rochester Royals all joined the NBA ( BAA ) in 1948 from the NBL . 
279	The Syracuse Nationals and Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA in 1949 as part of the BAA - NBL merger . 
280	The Indiana Pacers , New York Nets , San Antonio Spurs , and Denver Nuggets all joined the NBA in 1976 as part of the NBA - ABA merger . 
281	Following the summer break , teams begin training camps in late September . 
282	Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies ) , scout the team 's strengths and weaknesses , prepare the players for the rigorous regular season , and determine the 12-man active roster ( and a 3-man inactive list ) with which they will begin the regular season . 
283	Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA development league . 
284	After training camp , a series of preseason exhibition games are held . 
285	The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October . 
286	During the regular season , each team plays 82 games , 41 each home and away . 
287	A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year ( 16 games ) . 
288	Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times ( 24 games ) , and the remaining four teams three times ( 12 games ) . 
289	Finally , each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece ( 30 games ) . 
290	This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams ( but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB ) . 
291	Over five seasons , each team will have played 80 games against their division ( 20 games against each opponent , 10 at home , 10 on the road ) , 180 games against the rest of their conference ( 18 games against each opponent , 9 at home , 9 on the road ) , and 150 games against the other conference ( 10 games against each team , 5 at home , 5 on the road ) . 
292	As of 2008 , the NBA is one of only two of the Big 4 in North America in which teams play every other team during the regular season ( the other being the National Hockey League ) . 
293	Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season . 
294	For a few seasons until 2008 , the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team . 
295	The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day .

313	Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players . 
314	Christmas is also notable for NBA on television , as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season . 
315	Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season . 
316	thumbleftMilwaukee Bucksplaying theCharlotte Bobcatsin a regular season game In February , the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game . 
317	Fans vote throughout the United States , Canada , and on the Internet , and the top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a starting spot on their conference 's All-Star team . 
318	Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars . 
319	Then , Eastern conference players face the Western conference players in the All-Star game . 
320	The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award . 
321	Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rookie Challenge , where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play against each other in a 5-on-5 basketball game ; the Skills Challenge , where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting , passing , and dribbling in the fastest time ; the Three Point Contest , where players compete to score the most amount of three-point field goals in a given time ; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest , where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges . 
322	These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights . 
323	Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline , which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February ) at 3pm Eastern Time .

330	2012-01-05 , NBA.com 
331	After this date , teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season , although they may still sign and release players . 
332	Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline , making that day a hectic time for general managers . 
333	Around the middle of April , the regular season ends . 
334	It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards , as well as the selection of the honorary , league-wide , post-season teams . 
335	The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench ( must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started ) . 
336	The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player . 
337	The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season . 
338	The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league 's best defender . 
339	The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team . 
340	The Most Valuable Player Award is given to player deemed the most valuable for ( his team ) that season . 
341	Additionally , Sporting News awards an unofficial ( but widely recognized ) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise . 
342	The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team , the All-Defensive Team , and the All-Rookie Team ; each consists of five players . 
343	There are three All-NBA teams , consisting of the top players at each position , with first-team status being the most desirable . 
344	There are two All-Defensive teams , consisting of the top defenders at each position . 
345	There are also two All-Rookie teams , consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position . 
346	NBA Playoffs NBA Playoffs begin in late April , with eight teams in each conference going for the Championship . 
347	The three division winners , along with the team with the next best record from the conference are given the top four seeds . 
348	The next four teams in terms of record are given the lower four seeds . 
349	Having a higher seed offers several advantages . 
350	Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed , the second seed plays the seventh seed , the third seed plays the sixth seed , and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed , having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round . 
351	The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage , including the First Round . 
352	This means that , for example , if the team who receives the 5 seed has a better record than the team with the 4 seed ( by virtue of a divisional championship ) , the 5 seed would have home court advantage , even though the other team has a higher seed . 
353	Therefore , the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays . 
354	For example , in 2006 , the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the # 3 seed . 
355	Their opponent was the # 6 seeded Los Angeles Clippers , who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division . 
356	Although Denver won its much weaker division , the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in five games . 
357	The playoffs follow a tournament format . 
358	Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series , with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round , while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs . 
359	In the next round , the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference . 
360	All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs . 
361	Since the NBA does not re-seed teams , the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design , with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams , and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams . 
362	In every round except the NBA Finals , the best of seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern , meaning that one team will have home court in games 1 , 2 , 5 , and 7 , while the other plays at home in games 3 , 4 , and 6 . 
363	For the final round ( NBA Finals ) , the series follows a 2–3–2 pattern , meaning that one team will have home court in games 1 , 2 , 6 , and 7 , while the other plays at home in games 3 , 4 , and 5 . 
364	The 2–3–2 pattern in the NBA Finals has been in place since 1985 . 
365	The final playoff round , a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences , is known as the NBA Finals , and is held annually in June . 
366	The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy . 
367	Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring . 
368	In addition , the league awards a Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series . 
369	On August 2 , 2006 , the NBA announced the new playoff format . 
370	The new format takes the three division winners and the second-place team with the best record and rank them 1–4 by record . 
371	The other 4 slots are filled by best record other than those other 4 teams .

375	The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions . 
376	From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the Fédération Internationale de Basketball ( FIBA ) in the McDonald 's Championship .
