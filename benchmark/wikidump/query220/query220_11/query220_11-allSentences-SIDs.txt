27	The Chicago Bulls are actually the third NBA team in Chicago _ after the Packers–Zephyrs ( now the Washington Wizards ) and the Stags ( 1946–50 ) . 
28	The Bulls ' founder , Dick Klein , was the only owner to ever play professional basketball ( for the Chicago Gears ) . 
29	He served as the Bulls ' president and general manager for their formative years . 
30	The team began play for the 1966–67 NBA season , and immediately posted the best record by an expansion team in NBA history . 
31	Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star Johnny " Red " Kerr , and led by former NBA assist leader Guy Rodgers and forward Bob Boozer , the Bulls qualified for the playoffs . 
32	In their first two seasons , the Bulls played a majority of their home games at the International Amphitheatre , before they moved to the Chicago Stadium . 
33	Over the next few years , the Bulls assembled the pieces to be competitive , though they never quite reached the top . 
34	During the 1970s , the Bulls were known as a tough , defensive-minded team , built around hard-nosed defender Jerry Sloan , forwards Bob Love and Chet Walker , point guard Norm Van Lier , and centers Clifford Ray and Tom Boerwinkle . 
35	Nevertheless , the team only won one division title and never made it to the Finals . 
36	By the late 1970s and early 1980s , the team had hit the cellar of the league . 
37	The Bulls ' fortunes would have been forever changed were it not for a simple coin flip . 
38	In 1979 , the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to pick first in the NBA draft ( Rod Thorn , the Bulls General Manager , called "heads " ) . 
39	Had the Bulls won the toss , they would have selected the great Magic Johnson ; instead , they selected David Greenwood with the second pick . 
40	The Los Angeles Lakers selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the New Orleans Jazz , who traded the selection for Gail Goodrich . 
41	Artis Gilmore , acquired in the ABA dispersal draft in 1976 , led a Bulls squad which included guard Reggie Theus , forward David Greenwood , and forward Orlando Woolridge . 
42	After Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center Dave Corzine , the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered around Theus , and which soon included guards Quintin Dailey and Ennis Whatley . 
43	However , with continued dismal results , the Bulls decided to change directions , trading Theus to the Kansas City Kings during the 1983–84 season . 
44	thumbrightMichael Jordanwas drafted third overall by the Bulls in 1984 . 
45	In the summer of 1984 the team 's fortunes changed forever when it received the third pick of the 1984 NBA Draft , after Houston and Portland . 
46	The Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon , the Blazers jumped on Sam Bowie , and the Bulls grabbed shooting guard Michael Jordan out of the University of North Carolina . 
47	The team , with new management in owner Jerry Reinsdorf and General Manager Jerry Krause , decided to rebuild around Jordan . 
48	Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring ( 3rd in the league ) and steals ( 4th in the league ) , and led the Bulls back to the playoffs , for which he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award . 
49	In the following offseason , the team acquired point guard John Paxson and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward Charles Oakley . 
50	Along with Jordan and center Dave Corzine , they provided much of the Bulls ' offense for the next two years . 
51	After suffering a broken foot early in the 1985–86 season , Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring . 
52	Jordan returned for the playoffs , and took the 8th-place Bulls up against the 67–15 Boston Celtics , led by Larry Bird . 
53	Though the Bulls were swept , Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 ( which still stands to this day ) , prompting Bird to call him ' God disguised as Michael Jordan . 
54	' In the 1986 –87 NBA season , Jordan continued his assault on the record books , leading the league in scoring with 37.1 
55	points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team . 
56	Despite this , the Bulls could only muster a 40–42 win–loss record , which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs . 
57	However , the Bulls were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs . 
58	In the 1987 draft , to address their lack of depth Krause selected center Olden Polynice 8th overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall , then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the 5th selection , small forward Scottie Pippen . 
59	With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt , Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots , Corzine anchoring center , and rookie Pippen and Grant coming off the bench , the Bulls made major noise in the 1987 –88 season , winning 50 games and advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals , where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games . 
60	However , for his efforts , Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player , an award he would win four more times over his career . 
61	The 1987 –88 season would also mark the start of the Pistons - Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988-1991 . 
62	The 1988 –89 season marked a second straight year of major off-season moves . 
63	Popular power forward Charles Oakley , who had led the league in total rebounds in both '87 and '88 , was traded on the eve of the 1988 draft to the New York Knicks along with a Round 1 draft pick used by the Knicks on Rod Strickland for center Bill Cartwright and a 1st round draft pick which the Bulls used to obtain center Will Perdue . 
64	In addition , the Bulls acquired three-point specialist Craig Hodges from Phoenix . 
65	The new starting lineup of Paxson , Jordan , Pippen , Grant , and Cartwright took some time to mesh , winning fewer games than the previous season , but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals , where they were subdued in six games by the eventual NBA champion Pistons . 
66	In 1989–90 , Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season , and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Scottie Pippen . 
67	There was also a major change on the sidelines , where head coach Doug Collins was replaced by assistant Phil Jackson . 
68	The Bulls also picked up rookie center Stacey King and rookie point guard B.J. 
69	Armstrong in the 1989 draft . 
70	With these additional players and the previous year 's starting five , the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals , and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being edged out for the third straight year , who would go on to repeat as NBA champions . 
71	By the 1990–91 season , the Bulls charged through the year with a mission . 
72	They recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins , and romped through the playoffs , where they swept the defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals and won the Finals in 5 over the Magic Johnson -led Los Angeles Lakers on June 12 , 1991 . 
73	Michael Jordan won regular season MVP and Finals MVP to go with his fifth straight scoring title . 
74	The Bulls won their second straight title in 1992 after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67 . 
75	They prevailed over the Portland Trail Blazers and Clyde Drexler in six games . 
76	Jordan once again won regular season MVP and Finals MVP , to go with his sixth straight scoring title . 
77	During the Finals , Jordan broke the records for most points in a half with 35 and most 3-pointers in a half with 6 . 
78	( Ray Allen broke the latter on June 6 , 2010 with 7 3-pointers in a half ) . 
79	The Chicago Blackhawks played for the Stanley Cup at the same time the Bulls won this championship , but were swept by the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins . 
80	1992 was the only year that both the Bulls and Blackhawks played in their respective league 's finals in the same year . 
81	In 1992 the Bulls did what no team had done since the legendary Celtics of the '60s by chalking up the three-peat over regular season MVP Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns , with John Paxson 's 3-pointer with 3.9 
82	seconds left that gave them a 99–98 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix . 
83	Jordan was once again the Finals MVP after setting a Finals record for points per game with 41 . 
84	He also tied Wilt Chamberlain by winning his seventh straight scoring title . 
85	During the fall of 1993 , Jordan shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement , only months after learning of his father 's murder . 
86	The Bulls were then led by Scottie Pippen , who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the 1994 All- Star MVP . 
87	He received help from Horace Grant and B.J. 
88	Armstrong , who were named to their first all-star games . 
89	The three were assisted by Cartwright , Perdue , shooting guard Pete Myers , and Croatia rookie forward Toni Kukoč . 
90	Despite the Bulls ' amazing run during the 1993–94 season , where they won 55 games , they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of the playoffs , after a controversial foul call by referee Hue Hollins in game 5 of that series . 
91	( The Knicks eventually reached the finals that year , but lost to the Houston Rockets . 
92	) The Bulls opened the 1994–95 season by leaving their home of 27 years , Chicago Stadium , and moving into their current home , the United Center . 
93	In 1994 , the Bulls lost Horace Grant , Bill Cartwright , and Scott Williams to free agency , and John Paxson to retirement , but picked up shooting guard Ron Harper , the seeming heir-apparent to Michael Jordan in Assistant Coach Tex Winter 's triple-post offense , and small-forward Jud Buechler . 
94	The Bulls sported the look of Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt , Pippen and Kukoc at the forward spots , and Perdue at center . 
95	They also had sharpshooter Steve Kerr , whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993–94 season , Myers , and centers Luc Longley ( acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves ) and Bill Wennington . 
96	However , they were slumping during the season , when on March 17 , 1995 , they received the best possible news : Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement . 
97	He was soon among the best in the league again , scoring 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back , and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in the playoffs , where they upset the Charlotte Hornets . 
98	However , Jordan was too rusty , and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic , which included Horace Grant , Anfernee Hardaway , and Shaquille O'Neal . 
99	When Jordan returned to the Bulls , he initially wore No. 
100	45 ( which was his number while playing for the Birmingham Barons , a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox ) . 
101	He chose the No. 
102	45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school . 
103	Michael wanted to be half as good as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 ( 22.5 
104	) rounded up . 
105	However , Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic series . 
106	In the offseason , the Bulls lost B. 
107	J. 
108	Armstrong in the expansion draft , but Krause pulled off a masterful deal by trading Will Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for the aggressive and often controversial rebounding specialist Dennis Rodman , who had won the past four rebounding titles , and who had also been a member of the Detroit Pistons ' " Bad Boys " squad that served as the Bulls ' chief nemesis in the late 1980s .

123	The Bulls also posted the second-best home record in history ( 39–2 ) , behind only the 1985–86 Celtics 40–1 home mark , and the second-best point differential in history , trailing the 1972 Lakers by 3 points over the course of an entire season .

143	Many speculated this would be Michael Jordan 's final season with the team . 
144	Phil Jackson 's future with the team was also questionable , as his relationship with team general manager Jerry Krause was one of growing tension . 
145	Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved , but was not getting from the organization . 
146	In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls , they still had a remarkable season , with a final regular-season record of 62–20 . 
147	Michael Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time , and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference . 
148	The first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the New Jersey Nets , a team led by Kendall Gill and Sam Cassell . 
149	The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series . 
150	The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the Charlotte Hornets stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center , and tying the series 1–1 . 
151	But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series . 
152	The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the Reggie Miller -led Indiana Pacers . 
153	Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls . 
154	The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins , winning games 3 , 4 , and 6 , sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center . 
155	The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88–83 , winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship . 
156	In a much anticipated Finals , The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year , the Utah Jazz . 
157	Led by Karl Malone and John Stockton , the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls , winning game one at Utah 's Delta Center . 
158	Facing a potential two to nothing deficit , the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series . 
159	The Bulls returned to the United Center and , by winning the next two games , took a 3–1 series lead . 
160	The Jazz won Game 5 by two points , 83–81 . 
161	Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams , as the Jazz had a lead late in the game . 
162	Down by three points to the Jazz , Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win . 
163	Jordan hit a driving layup to bring the Bulls within 1 , then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit the game winning shot with 5.2 
164	seconds remaining on the clock . 
165	With a score of 87–86 , John Stockton put up a three pointer , but missed , sealing the Bulls ' sixth championship in eight years . 
166	Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career . 
167	He retired for the second time on January 13 , 1999 .

173	2009-08-01 Krause felt that the Bulls were on the verge of being too old and unable to compete . 
174	He decided that the team 's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline . 
175	His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years ' time . 
176	After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf , Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy Rogers ( who was released in February 1999 ) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets . 
177	He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman , and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks . 
178	He hired a new coach , Tim Floyd , who had run a successful program at Iowa State University . 
179	Upon Phil Jackson 's departure , Michael Jordan made his second retirement official . 
180	With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown , shooting guard Ron Harper , newcomer Brent Barry at small forward , power forward Toni Kukoc , and center Bill Wennington , the team began the lockout -shortened 1998–99 season . 
181	Kukoc led the team in scoring , rebounding , and assists , but the team won only 13 of 50 games . 
182	The previous year 's dismal finish came with one highlight : the team won the draft lottery and the rights to power forward Elton Brand . 
183	Since the team lost Harper , Wennington and Barry in the offseason , Brand and fellow rookie Ron Artest led the team throughout the year , especially after Kukoc missed most of the season due to injury and was then dealt for a draft pick at the trading deadline . 
184	Brand recorded the first 20–10 average for the Bulls since the days of Artis Gilmore . 
185	He led all rookies in scoring , rebounds , blocks , field goal percentage and minutes , while Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring . 
186	For his efforts Brand was named 1999–2000 co- Rookie of the Year with Houston 's Steve Francis , and to the all-rookie first team , while Artest was named to the all-rookie second team . 
187	However , the team established a franchise low at 17–65 , second worst in the league . 
188	After a summer in which the Bulls witnessed most major and minor free agents Tim Duncan , Grant Hill , Tracy McGrady , Eddie Jones and even Tim Thomas choose to stay with their teams ( or go elsewhere ) rather than sign with them , Krause signed free agent center Brad Miller and shooting guard Ron Mercer , and drafted power forward Marcus Fizer and traded draft pick Chris Mihm to Cleveland for the rights of guard Jamal Crawford . 
189	Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds with another 20–10 season , but the new acquisitions failed to make a major impact , and they finished with the worst record in team history at 15–67 . 
190	Krause shocked Bulls fans on draft day in 2001 when he traded franchise player Brand to the Los Angeles Clippers for the second pick in the draft , Tyson Chandler . 
191	He also selected Eddy Curry with the fourth pick . 
192	Since both Chandler and Curry came straight out of high school , neither was expected to make much of a contribution for several years , but they were seen as potential franchise players . 
193	The team floundered without veteran leadership . 
194	At mid-season , the Bulls traded their top three scorers — Mercer , Artest , and Miller along with Kevin Ollie—to the Indiana Pacers for veteran guard Jalen Rose , Travis Best and Norman Richardson . 
195	There was also a change in coaching , with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright , following a series of arguments with players and management . 
196	The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins , although they were still tied for last in the league . 
197	For the 2002–03 season , the Bulls came to play with much optimism . 
198	They picked up college phenom Jay Williams with the second pick in the draft . 
199	Williams teamed with Jalen Rose , Crawford , Fizer , newcomer Donyell Marshall , Curry , Chandler , and guard Trenton Hassell to form a young and exciting nucleus which improved to 30–52 in Bill Cartwright 's first full season as head coach . 
200	Curry led the league in field goal percentage , becoming the first Bull since Jordan to lead the league in a major statistical category . 
201	During the summer of 2003 , long-time GM Jerry Krause retired , and former player and color commentator John Paxson was tabbed as his successor . 
202	Jay Williams , coming off a promising rookie campaign , was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident . 
203	His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and he has yet to return to the game . 
204	Paxson selected point guard Kirk Hinrich with the seventh pick in the draft , and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen . 
205	With Pippen playing , Cartwright at the sidelines , and Paxson in the front office , the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return . 
206	However , the 2003–04 season was a resounding disappointment . 
207	Eddy Curry regressed , leading to questions about his conditioning and commitment . 
208	Tyson Chandler was plagued by a chronic back injury , missing more than thirty games . 
209	Pippen 's ability to influence games was impaired by knee problems , and he openly contemplated retirement . 
210	Jamal Crawford remained inconsistent . 
211	Bill Cartwright was fired as head coach in December and replaced with former Phoenix coach Scott Skiles . 
212	A trade with the Toronto Raptors brought Antonio Davis and Jerome Williams in exchange for Rose and Marshall in what was seen as a major shift in team strategy from winning with athleticism to winning with hard work and defense . 
213	After struggling throughout the season , the Bulls finished with 23 wins and 59 losses , the second-worst record in the league . 
214	Fizer was not re-signed , and Crawford was re-signed and traded to the Knicks for expiring contracts . 
215	Hinrich provided the lone bright spot , becoming a fan favorite for his gritty determination and tenacious defense . 
216	He won a place on the All-Rookie first team . 
217	During the 2004 offseason , Paxson traded a 2005 draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in return for an additional pick in the 2004 NBA Draft . 
218	He used the picks to select Connecticut guard Ben Gordon and Duke small forward Luol Deng in the first round , and Duke point guard Chris Duhon in the second . 
219	Paxson also signed free agent small forward Andrés Nocioni , who had recently won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the Argentine national team . 
220	After losing the first nine games of the season , the Bulls began to show signs of improvement behind their improved team defense and clutch fourth-quarter play from Gordon . 
221	The Bulls , who were 0–9 to start the season , finished the regular season 47–35 , with the third-best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the NBA playoffs for the first time since Jordan 's departure . 
222	In the first round , the 4th-seeded Bulls played the Washington Wizards . 
223	The Bulls opened the series with two wins at home , but lost the next four games and the series . 
224	After the season , Ben Gordon became the first rookie to win the NBA Sixth Man Award and the first Bull to win the award since 1996 with Toni Kukoč . 
225	During the 2005 offseason , the Bulls re-signed free agent Tyson Chandler . 
226	However , Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart disease resulting of a heart murmur during checkups , and Paxson would not clear him to play without extensive DNA testing . 
227	Ultimately , Curry refused to participate in the tests , and he was traded along with Antonio Davis to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney , Tim Thomas , and what became the second pick of the 2006 NBA Draft —as well as the right to swap picks with New York in the 2007 NBA Draft . 
228	Without a significant post presence , the Bulls struggled for most of the 2005–06 season . 
229	However , a late-season 12–2 surge allowed them to finish 41–41 and qualify for the 2006 playoffs as the seventh seed . 
230	There , the Bulls faced the Miami Heat . 
231	After two close losses in Miami , the Bulls broke through with a blowout win in Game 3 , and another win in Game 4 . 
232	However , the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that year 's championship . 
233	The Bulls ' several young players nevertheless earned additional postseason experience , and Nocioni turned in a remarkable series of performances that far exceeded his season averages . 
234	In the 2006 NBA Draft , the Bulls were awarded forward-center LaMarcus Aldridge and immediately traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers for forward Tyrus Thomas and forward Viktor Khryapa . 
235	In a second draft-day trade , the Bulls selected Rodney Carney and traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for guard Thabo Sefolosha . 
236	Later that summer , four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace signed with the Bulls for a reported four-year , $ 60&nbsp;million contract . 
237	Following the signing of Wallace , the Bulls traded Tyson Chandler , the last remaining player of the Krause era , to the ( then ) New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for veteran power forward P.J. 
238	Brown and J.R. 
239	Smith and salary cap space that was used to sign former Chicago co-captain Adrian Griffin . 
240	In 2006–07 , the Bulls overcame a 3–9 season start to finish 49–33 , the third-best record in the Eastern Conference . 
241	In the first round , the Bulls again faced Miami , the defending NBA champions . 
242	The Bulls narrowly won Game 1 at home , then followed it with a blowout victory in Game 2. 
243	In Miami , the Bulls rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to win Game 3 and then posted another comeback win in Game 4 . 
244	The Bulls ' four-game sweep of the defending champions stunned many NBA observers . 
245	It was Chicago 's first playoff series victory since 1998 , Jordan 's last season with the team . 
246	The Bulls then advanced to face the Detroit Pistons , marking the first time the Central Division rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991 . 
247	The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. 
248	No NBA team had ever come back from a 0–3 deficit to win the series , but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points . 
249	The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit , and had a chance to make NBA history . 
250	But they lost at home in game 6 by 10 , and the Pistons won the series 4–2 on May 17 . 
251	During the off season , the Bulls signed forward Joe Smith and guard Adrian Griffin , and drafted center Joakim Noah . 
252	However , distractions began when Luol Deng and Ben Gordon turned down contract extensions , never citing reasons . 
253	Then rumors surfaced that the Bulls were pursuing stars like Kevin Garnett , Pau Gasol , and most notably , Kobe Bryant . 
254	None of these deals happened , and general manager John Paxson denied a deal was ever imminent . 
255	The Bulls started the 2007–08 NBA season by losing 10 of their first 12 games and on December 24 , 2007 , after a 9–16 start , the Bulls fired head coach Scott Skiles . 
256	Jim Boylan was named the interim head coach on December 27 , 2007 . 
257	On February 21 , 2008 , Ben Wallace , Joe Smith , Adrian Griffin and the Bulls ' 2009 2nd round draft pick http ://www.nba.com/bulls/news

270	After Jim Boylan 's interim tenure expired , the Bulls began the process of selecting a new head coach . 
271	They were in talks with former Phoenix head coach Mike D'Antoni , but on May 10 , 2008 he signed with the New York Knicks . 
272	Other possible options included former Dallas head coach Avery Johnson and former Bulls head coach Doug Collins .

275	John Paxson hired Vinny Del Negro , with no coaching experience , to coach the young Bulls .

287	The Bulls re-signed Luol Deng to a six-year $ 71&nbsp;million contract on July 30 , 2008 . 
288	He was later plagued with an injury keeping him from action for most of the 2008–2009 season .

346	Turner Sports Interactive , Inc June 23 , 2010 On July 7 , 2010 it was revealed that Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz had verbally agreed to an $ 80&nbsp;million , five year contract . 
347	Afterwards , the Bulls traded veteran point guard Kirk Hinrich to the Washington Wizards to create more cap space . 
348	The Bulls also signed former 76er and Jazz guard Kyle Korver to a 3 year , $ 15&nbsp;million contract . 
349	The same day that the Chicago Bulls signed Kyle Korver , they signed Turkish All- Star Ömer Aşık . 
350	After being matched by the Orlando Magic for J.J. 
351	Redick they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season in shooting guard Ronnie Brewer , traded for former Warrior point guard C.J. 
352	Watson , and signed former Bucks power forward Kurt Thomas as well as former Spurs player Keith Bogans and former Celtics player Brian Scalabrine . 
353	Chicago finished the regular season with an NBA league-best 62–20 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 1998 . 
354	The Bulls entered the playoffs , and defeated the Indiana Pacers and the Atlanta Hawks in five and six games , respectively . 
355	They then reached the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1998 , and faced the Miami Heat . 
356	After winning the first game of the series by a substantial amount , they lost the next four games to Miami , ending their 2010–2011 season . 
357	During the off-season , the Bulls drafted Jimmy Butler 30th overall in the 2011 NBA draft . 
358	After the NBA lockout ended , the Bulls lost Kurt Thomas to free agency , and released Keith Bogans . 
359	The Bulls signed veteran shooting guard Richard " Rip " Hamilton to a three-year deal , after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons . 
360	The Bulls also gave MVP Derrick Rose a 5 year contract extension worth $ 94.8 
361	million dollars . 
362	During the Bulls ' run of dominance , the player introductions became world famous . 
363	Longtime announcer Tommy Edwards was the first to use " Sirius " , " On The Run " and other songs in game presentation in the NBA . 
364	When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio , he was replaced by Ray Clay in 1990 , and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions , including the music , The Alan Parsons Project 's " Sirius " , for all six championship runs . 
365	The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction , accompanied by " The Imperial March " from Star Wars composed by John Williams , or " On the Run " by Pink Floyd . 
366	Then virtually all lights in the stadium are shut off for the Bulls introduction , and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court ; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions . 
367	Since the move to the United Center , lasers and fireworks have been added , and with improvements to the arena 's White Way video screen , computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added . 
368	These graphics feature the 3D-animated ' Running of the Bulls ' en route to the United Center , along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team 's logo . 
369	Coincidentally , Alan Parsons wrote " Sirius " for his own band and was the sound engineer for " On the Run " from Pink Floyd 's album The Dark Side of the Moon . 
370	Traditionally , the players have been introduced in the following order : small forward , power forward , center , point guard , shooting guard . 
371	Thus during the championship era , Scottie Pippen was usually the first ( or second ) Bulls player introduced , and Michael Jordan the last . 
372	( Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams . 
373	) More recently with Derrick Rose 's arrival , the guards have been reversed in order , making the Chicago -bred point guard the last player introduced . 
374	Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay , the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of Tommy Edwards as the announcer .

417	Blackhawks ' circus trip starts with thud Kuc Chris November 14 , 2007 Chicago Tribune November 4 , 2011 thumbleft175pxBulls logo upon the bow of theUSS Chicago ( SSN-721) USS Chicago . 
418	The iconic Bulls ' logo is a red bull 's face with an angry expression . 
419	The horns are tipped with blood . 
420	The logo was designed by noted American sports artist Theodore W. 
421	Drake and was adopted in 1966 . 
422	At one point , the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 70s , featuring the same Bulls logo , but with a cloud that says " Windy City " below the bull 's nose . 
423	The Bulls have three different uniforms : a white home uniform , a red road uniform , and a black alternate road uniform . 
424	The design of the white and red sets are nearly identical , with the team name featured on the front over the number , and the player 's last name over the number on the back and under the Bulls ' logo . 
425	The shorts have the Bulls logo in a diamond shaped design on the sides of the legs . 
426	The red and white uniforms have remained mostly unchanged since 1966 , with minor modifications from off-centered numbers to a cursive " Chicago " lettering on the road uniforms . 
427	The less-often used black uniform ( often used 10 times per season ) shares the same design as the white and the red ones , except that " Bulls " is replaced with " Chicago " on the front of the jersey . 
428	It was first introduced during Chicago 's 72-win run in the 1995–96 NBA season , in which it shared a similar design to the Bulls ' regular road and home uniforms except that it featured pinstripes and a diamond that is not featured around the Bulls ' logo in the shorts . 
429	This design was resurrected as part of the NBA Hardwood Classics Nights program , as well as NBA Heritage Week presentations ( Dec. 
430	7–14 , 2007 ) throughout the 2007–08 season . 
431	In the 1999–2000 season , the pinstripes were removed and " Chicago " replaced " Bulls " above the number in the jersey front . 
432	Beginning in the 2006-07 NBA Season , the player 's name on the back of the alternate jersey changed its color to white from the red/white combination , and the red diamond was added to surround the logo in the sides of the shorts . 
433	The player 's name was reverted back to the red/white combo in the 2007–08 NBA season . 
434	thumbrightThe green uniforms . 
435	The Bulls wear white shoes at home during the regular season , but black shoes on the road and black shoes all throughout the playoffs , both at home and on the road . 
436	The unofficial playoff tradition goes back to the Jordan era , recommended by Brad Sellers as a show of team unity . 
437	The Bulls also wear only their red uniform on the road during the playoffs . 
438	During the 2008–09 season and first three games of the playoffs , however , the Bulls wore black sneakers on away games only while wearing white sneakers on home games . 
439	Since the 2009–10 season , however , the NBA has relaxed its rules on specific sneaker colors on home and away games , and several Bulls players are seen wearing white sneakers on the road , or black at home during the regular season , even seen wearing red on occasion . 
440	In 2006 the Bulls were one of three teams to take part in the NBA 's first ever St . 
441	Patrick 's Day uniform program ( with the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks ) . 
442	The program consisted of the teams wearing specially designed green uniforms . 
443	For the program The Bulls ' changed their red road uniforms to green while maintaining the traditional red and black bull 's head on the shorts and the back of the jersey as well as the wording of " Bulls " on the front remaining black . 
444	The Bulls wore these uniforms on March 18 against the Miami Heat .

470	Bulls–Pistons rivalry Bulls– Heat rivalry Bulls–Knicks rivalry The Bulls ' primary rivals have been the Detroit Pistons ever since the Jordan -led Bulls met the " Bad Boy " Pistons in the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals . 
471	The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years , with the Pistons winning each time until 1991 . 
472	The Eastern Conference Finals in 1991 ended with a four game sweep of the Pistons , who , in an unprofessional manner , walked off the floor with time still on the game clock . 
473	The rivalry was renewed in the 2007 Eastern Conference Semifinals , in which former Detroit cornerstone Ben Wallace met his former team ( the Pistons won in 6 games ) . 
474	The geographic proximity and membership in the Central Division further intensify the rivalry , which has been characterized by intense , physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s . 
475	Chicago fans have been known to have a disliking for Detroit professional teams , as it is the only city that is in the same division as Chicago in all four major North American sports . 
476	" Detroit Sucks " is commonly chanted when playing any Detroit team . 
477	The Bulls also had an intense rivalry with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1980s and early 1990s . 
478	Unlike the rivalry with the Pistons , in which the two teams have been relatively competitive , the Bulls -Cavs rivalry has been one of the more one-sided rivalries , heavily favoring the Bulls . 
479	Twice , Michael Jordan hit game - and series - winning shots against the Cavaliers in the playoffs . 
480	The rivalry was renewed in the 2010 NBA Playoffs , but this time the Cavaliers reversed the situation with LeBron James , who led the Cavs past the Bulls in five games . 
481	Another franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the New York Knicks . 
482	The two met in the playoffs in four consecutive years ( 1991–94 ) and again in 1996 , with the teams ' series twice ( 1992 and 1994 ) going the full seven games . 
483	Their first playoff confrontation , however , came in 1989 when both teams were called "teams on the rise " under Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing , respectively . 
484	That first confrontation would belong to Chicago in six games of the Eastern Semifinals . 
485	The Bulls triumphed in the first three years ( 1991–93 ) before narrowly losing in 1994 but exacted revenge in 1996 . 
486	As with Detroit , the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans . 
487	List of Chicago Bulls seasons The team currently trains at the Berto Center , located at 550 Lake Cook Rd , Deerfield , Illinois .
