618	The Boston Celtics released a new logo for the 1996–97 season , although the depiction of a leprechaun spinning a basketball has been in use since the early 1950s . 
619	The leprechaun logo was originally designed by Zang Auerbach , the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach . 
620	The logo has received numerous tweaks over the years ; the latest version decorated the leprechaun in a gold vest to celebrate the club 's 50th anniversary . 
621	, sportslogos .net 
622	. 
623	Retrieved February 2 , 2008 . 
624	The most familiar version , however , is the one-colored logo used during the Larry Bird era , with the leprechaun traced in black and only green and white clothes , which is still used on some TV networks whenever the current Celtics logo is unavailable or in classic Celtics references . 
625	, sportslogos .net 
626	. 
627	Retrieved February 3 , 2008 . 
628	The logo made its debut midway through the 1975–76 season , albeit in green pants , at the center court of their trademark parquet floor . 
629	The official version with white pants debuted in the 1976–77 season . 
630	In the 1993–94 season , the pants on the center court were repainted white . 
631	Finally in the 1996–97 season , in coinciding with the team 's ( and the NBA 's ) 50th anniversary , the Celtics repainted the leprechaun logo to include gold on the vest , bow tie and hat , as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh , and black on its pants and shoes . 
632	Its face and hands were both painted tan . 
633	The one-colored leprechaun logo was revived for the 2011–12 season as an alternate logo , and will be prominently seen on the team website as well as banners during post-game interviews . 
634	The Celtics also have various alternative logos , with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters " Celtics " above it , wrapped in a green circle , which has been used since the 1998–99 season . 
635	The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun . 
636	For much of its history , the shamrock was trimmed in gold , as seen in the old team warmup jackets .

638	Except for some minor modifications , most notably the serifed version of the uniforms during the Bill Russell era , the jerseys remained unchanged through the years . 
639	Beginning in 2005–06 , the Celtics began using alternate road jerseys which are green with black lettering and trim featuring the word " Boston " on the front side of the jersey . 
640	The alternate road jersey made few appearances in its first 2 seasons , but since 2007 it has been used much more often , in more than half of the road games . 
641	The uniforms traditionally make their debut on the last Friday of November home games , and are used on the road for games after that . 
642	Also , in 2005–06 , the Celtics began a tradition of wearing green jerseys with gold trim as part of the St . 
643	Patrick 's Day celebrations the NBA puts into place every third week of March . 
644	Except for the word " Boston " in front and the gold trim , the St . 
645	Patrick 's Day jerseys resemble the regular road jerseys . 
646	For the first four years , the St . 
647	Patty 's jerseys were used four times , a majority of which on the road ; however in the 2009-10 NBA season , they were used just twice ( both home games ) . 
648	During the 2006–07 season , the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname " Red " in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach , who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season .

656	In the second game in London , the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack . 
657	At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers , the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms , accented with gold , to commemorate last season 's championship team . 
658	The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey . 
659	It has been featured seven times in the history of the franchise : Walter Brown ( 1964–65 ) , Bob Schmertz ( 1975–76 ) , Joan Cohen ( 1989–90 ) , Johnny Most ( 1993–94 ) , Reggie Lewis ( 1993–94 ) , Dorothy Auerbach ( 2000–01 ) and Dennis Johnson ( 2006–07 ) . 
660	The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history , except during the early 1980s when they wore green sneakers . 
661	According to legend , Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers , claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty ; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers . 
662	But prior to the 2003–04 season , current Celtics GM Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers , in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers . 
663	Auerbach gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games . 
664	They still wear the black sneakers on away games , but in the 2008–09 season , they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St . 
665	Patrick 's Day jerseys on the road . 
666	Most recently , when the Celtics play on Christmas Day , they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents .

671	Kahn May 11 , 2003 Since the 2009–10 season , the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors , allowing several players such as Rajon Rondo to wear white sneakers on the road , or black at home , and sometimes solid green either home or away . 
672	The Celtics are the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back . 
673	During the 1980s , this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets , but by the late 1990s , this style gradually declined . 
674	The Celtics , however , decided to keep the design in keeping with tradition . 
675	Their warmups generally coincide with whatever uniform they are wearing for that game—based on white for home games , based on green for away games , based on black for alternate jerseys .

701	This rivalry , which Celtics Coach Doc Rivers has been on both sides of , having played for the Knicks from 1992 start to 1993 end ( Knicks went to the 1994 Finals ) , attributes and stems mainly from the rivalries between teams from New York City and Boston , which are three and a half hours apart by car , ( New York being the nearest major professional sports market to Boston ) and the bigger Yankees–Red Sox rivalry in Major League Baseball .
