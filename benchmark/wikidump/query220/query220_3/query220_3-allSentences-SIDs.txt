1	List of NBA champions The NBA Finals is the championship series of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . 
2	The series was named the NBA World Championship Series until 1986 . 
3	The series is played between the winners of Western Conference Finals and Eastern Conference Finals . 
4	At the conclusion of the championship round , the winners of the NBA Finals are awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy . 
5	( Winners from 1946 to 1977 received the Walter A. 
6	Brown Trophy ) The NBA Finals has been played at the conclusion of every NBA and BAA season in history , the first being held in 1947 . 
7	Since 1985 , the winner of the NBA Finals has been determined through a 2–3–2 format . 
8	The first two and the last two games of the series are played at the arena of the team who earned home court advantage by having the better record during the regular season . 
9	section December 2007 List of NBA champions During the first decade the Minneapolis Lakers had the first NBA dynasty , winning 5 championships in 6 years under Hall of Fame head coach John Kundla . 
10	The team also featured George Mikan , one of the greatest players in the history of the NBA . 
11	Franchises which had previously been in the National Basketball League tended to dominate , especially the Minneapolis Lakers . 
12	The Boston Celtics went 11–1 in the NBA Finals during thirteen seasons ( 1956–1957 to 1968–1969 ) . 
13	The Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals 8 years in a row during the 1958–59 to 1965–66 NBA seasons .

16	The Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers made up 19 of 26 possible NBA appearances during thirteen seasons ( 1956–1957 to 1968–1969 ) . 
17	The two teams met 6 times during the 8 years Boston won the NBA in a row . 
18	This period includes one season ( 1958–1959 ) when the Lakers were still based in Minneapolis , and it marks the largest stretch of seasons ( 14 ) that two teams made up over 65 % of NBA appearances , second being the 10 seasons ( 1979–1980 to 1988 –1989 ) the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers appeared 13 times . 
19	For most of the late 1950s and the 1960s , the Celtics seemed always to have the upper hand on Wilt Chamberlain 's teams . 
20	With the establishment of the Celtics dynasty in 1957 , Bill Russell became the star of the league . 
21	The seventh game of that year 's championship was decided on a Celtics basket in the final seconds of the second overtime . 
22	In 1964 , Wilt Chamberlain , who had moved to California with his team , the former Philadelphia Warriors , led the San Francisco Warriors to a Western Conference championship , but again failed to conquer the Celtics . 
23	The following season , he was traded back to Philadelphia , to join the 76ers , the former Syracuse Nationals team that had moved to cover the vacancy created with the departure of the Warriors . 
24	1966 produced a clash between the two stars in the playoffs , and Boston won 4–1 . 
25	Chamberlain 's coach told him to play a team game , not an individual game , and thus avoid drawing double-teams . 
26	His new-found team spirit brought them to a new record of 68 wins the following season , and they defeated the Celtics and then advanced to , and won , the Finals . 
27	In 1968 , Boston overcame a 3–1 deficit against Philadelphia to once again arrive in the Finals . 
28	Playing against Jerry West 's Lakers , they seemed doomed to defeat . 
29	Nevertheless , for the sixth consecutive time , they defeated L.A. 
30	, winning by a four games to two margin . 
31	The following year , 1969 , found the Celtics overcoming even longer odds . 
32	Boston barely qualified for the playoffs , finishing fourth in the East . 
33	The Lakers , who in the offseason added Chamberlain to join West and Elgin Baylor , won the West and were prohibitive favorites to finally win it all for the first time since relocating to LA . 
34	They easily won the first two games at the Los Angeles Forum . 
35	However , when the series shifted to the Boston Garden , the Celtics won two close games , by margins of 110–105 and 88–87 , respectively , in Games 3 and 4 . 
36	The fifth game , played at the Forum , returned the advantage to the Lakers , but the sixth game was a massive Celtics win , with Chamberlain scoring just two points . 
37	Game 7 was held on May 5 , with balloons hung up in the arena in anticipation of a Lakers victory . 
38	Russell immediately used the balloons as an inspiration for his team September 2007 , and they raced off to an early start and held off a furious Lakers comeback to win 108–106 and take the series , their eleventh championship in thirteen years . 
39	This game represented the final one in this first incarnation of the Celtics ' dynasty . 
40	The 1970s saw eight different teams win the title , with the Celtics and Knicks both winning twice . 
41	In 1970 , a classic final featured the New York Knicks against the Lakers . 
42	In the waning moments of Game 3 , with the series tied , Jerry West hit a basket from sixty feet away to tie the game , a shot which would become one of the most famous ever . 
43	Although the Knicks went on to win the game in overtime and continued their momentum for a 4–3 win , the Lakers were not defeated . 
44	Just two seasons later , the team won thirty-three games consecutively , the longest such streak in NBA history . 
45	By the season 's end , they had broken the record for most wins in a season , tallying up 69 wins , one more than the 1966–67 76ers . 
46	The Lakers finally , after a tough playoff-season , took home the championship for the first time since the Minneapolis days . 
47	The Knicks won the championship again in 1973 , using much the same formula , for their second franchise victorious season . 
48	The 1974 championship went back to the Celtics as the remaining players demonstrated excellent teamwork and resilience in the Finals . 
49	The late seventies were characterized by a major breakthrough of the league 's western franchises . 
50	In 1975 , after compiling a 48–34 regular-season record , the Golden State Warriors swept the heavily-favored Washington Bullets 4–0 in an upset . 
51	The next year , 1976 , saw the rise of the Phoenix Suns . 
52	Only eight years in existence , they overcame a losing record early in the season to build remarkable win streaks to finish 42–40 . 
53	The events culminated in upset victories over Seattle and Golden State . 
54	In the final against Boston , the teams split the first four games . 
55	Game 5 became one of the most memorable games of all . 
56	It went into three overtimes but eventually went to Boston 128–126 . 
57	Two days later , the Celtics finished Phoenix off 87-80 in Game 6 for their 13th championship . 
58	Other western franchises that won their first titles in the late 70 's included the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977 and the Seattle SuperSonics in 1979 . 
59	Portland 's victory was against the heavily favored Philadelphia 76ers led by Julius Erving . 
60	Although the Washington Bullets were able to defeat Seattle in the 1978 NBA Finals , Seattle was able to prevail the following year against the Bullets to win its first NBA title . 
61	Between 1980 and 1989 , the Celtics and/or the Lakers played in every NBA Finals . 
62	The Lakers won five titles during this span ( 1980 , 1982 , 1985 , 1987 and 1988 ) ; the Celtics won three ( 1981 , 1984 and 1986 ) , the Pistons won twice ( 1989 , 1990 ) , and the Sixers won once ( 1983 ) . 
63	The 1979 NCAA Championship Game featured Earvin " Magic " Johnson 's Michigan State University team facing off against Larry Bird 's Indiana State team . 
64	Michigan State won the game . 
65	This meeting has been immortalized , in fact , it attracted the largest ever TV rating for an NCAA Championship game , with 38 percent of all television viewers that night tuned to the game . 
66	September 2007 Bird had actually been drafted the year before , but later decided to stay in college for one more year , and the two superstars both entered the league that same year , 1979 , leading their respective teams to dazzling heights . 
67	Johnson 's Lakers reached the finals in 1980 , and took a 3–2 lead , but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could not play in Game 6 due to injury . 
68	Johnson shifted to center , ended up playing every position on the court and scored 42 points to win his first championship , a remarkable performance in the annals of the sport . 
69	Boston won the 1981 championship against Houston thanks to Bird , and the team continued dominating the league afterwards , taking many Atlantic Division titles . 
70	Philadelphia , led by Moses Malone and Julius Erving , took the 1983 prize , losing only once in the entire playoffs , and sweeping the Lakers . 
71	( Malone had predicted earlier that they would sweep every series . 
72	) However , in the 1984 NBA Finals , the Celtics and Lakers met for the first time since 1969 , and again , from Bird 's performance , the Celtics toppled Johnson 's Lakers 4–3 . 
73	The seventh game of that series attracted the largest TV audience ever for an NBA game , and the second-largest ever for a basketball game , with only the game between the two stars played five years earlier having a larger audience . 
74	It was the last NBA Finals played in the 2–2–1–1–1 format . 
75	In the 1985 championship , the Lakers made amends for their previous eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them in six games . 
76	After losing the first game in a rout , 148–114 , dubbed the " Memorial Day massacre " , they won four out of five , including the clincher in Boston Garden , to finally end the long years of frustration of failing to defeat the Boston Celtics . 
77	This finals was the first to be played in the current 2–3–2 NBA Finals format , which Red Auerbach suggested to David Stern in order to cut back on the frequent traveling between Boston and Los Angeles . 
78	Auerbach said years later , it was terrible that they went to this format because it takes away the home court advantage from the team with the first two games at home and they do n't get to host the all but crucial Game 5 , which is the swing game in a 7 game series . 
79	The 1986 NBA Finals brought the Celtics back against the Houston Rockets . 
80	Boston won in six games , taking their sixteenth championship , with the MVP award going to Larry Bird , his second Finals MVP trophy . 
81	In 1987 , the Lakers and Celtics met again for a rubber match . 
82	Both sides had won one series , and now a third was being played . 
83	The Lakers pounded out two victories , but Boston took the third . 
84	Game 4 would be one of the most memorable games ever played . 
85	In the waning moments , Magic Johnson scored a skyhook to give the Lakers a 107–106 win , and a 3–1 series lead . 
86	They dropped one more , but won Game 6 to take the series . 
87	This championship team was recently voted the best in history by the NBA 's officials and experts . 
88	In 1988 and 1989 , the aging Celtics failed to reach the Finals , with the Lakers and Pistons becoming the best of their conferences . 
89	The 1988 finals went to Los Angeles in seven games , but the Pistons swept the Lakers in 1989 . 
90	In 1990 , Detroit beat the Portland Trail Blazers in five games , and the name " Bad Boys " became attached to the team for its rough , physical play . 
91	During the 1990s the Bulls completed two three-peats . 
92	The decade also had the Rockets winning back-to-back championships and the Jazz falling short twice . 
93	It started with the Pistons winning their second championship in as many seasons . 
94	The majority of the 1990s was marked by the rise of the Chicago Bulls dynasty (otherwise known as the " Michael Jordan era" ) , which ended in 1998 . 
95	Coached by head coach Phil Jackson and led by superstar Michael Jordan , the Bulls won six championships from 1991 to 1998 . 
96	Supported by such remarkable players as Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman , Jordan led the Bulls to victory in all NBA Finals series they competed in , and won the Finals MVP award each time . 
97	Particularly memorable were the 1993 Finals , which became an offensive showdown between Jordan and regular-season MVP ( and close friend ) Charles Barkley . 
98	Game 3 of the 1993 Finals is widely considered one of the greatest basketball games ever played . 
99	The Bulls attempted to go up 3–0 in the series , but the Suns were not willing to seal their own doom . 
100	With neither side quitting , the game took three overtimes to decide , with the Suns finally prevailing 129–121 . 
101	However , the Bulls would clinch the series in Game 6 at Phoenix on John Paxson 's clutch three pointer to become only the third team in history to three-peat . 
102	The Houston Rockets , led by Hakeem Olajuwon , won the 1994 and 1995 NBA championships . 
103	Olajuwon dominated the game during those two seasons , becoming the only player in history to win the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award , NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award , and NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in the same season ( 1993–94 ) . 
104	The seven-game NBA Finals between the Rockets and Knicks in 1994 would be the last to reach a game seven until the 2005 series between San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons . 
105	It was also the only year that both NBA and NHL finals would go a full seven games , but also involve teams from one city . 
106	The Rockets ' win in Game 7 denied New York from having both NBA and NHL title in the same year , as the Rangers won the Stanley Cup during the series . 
107	The Rockets swept the Orlando Magic in the 1995 Finals , Olajuwon again claiming honors as Finals MVP. 
108	The Rockets thus became only the fifth franchise to win back-to-back titles . 
109	After a short stint as a baseball player , Jordan decided to return to basketball in late of the 1994–95 season ( March 19 ) . 
110	Although he failed to lead the Bulls to the Finals in that year , he returned to pre-retirement form the next year while the team acquired power forward Dennis Rodman , leading the Bulls to one of the most memorable seasons ever . 
111	The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls finished the regular season with a record of 72–10 , the best regular season record of any team in the history of the NBA . 
112	They proceeded to dominate in the playoffs , with series records of 3–0 , 4–1 and 4–0 , and then went on to defeat Gary Payton , Shawn Kemp and the Seattle SuperSonics in 6 games in the NBA Finals . 
113	In 1997 and 1998 , the Bulls met the Utah Jazz . 
114	Led by Olympians John Stockton and Karl Malone , the Jazz were defeated in both Finals by the Bulls in six games . 
115	In both series , Chicago won by hitting winning shots in the sixth and deciding game-the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago and the second by Jordan in Utah the following year . 
116	Although Jordan , Pippen and coach Phil Jackson were the only three members involved in all six championships , the Bulls dynasty had a cast of characters that proved to be decisive in obtaining the ultimate prize . 
117	Horace Grant , Bill Cartwright , John Paxson , B.J. 
118	Armstrong and other supporting cast members were pieces added to the puzzle to create the first three-peat of the dynasty . 
119	Of the second , little-known players such as Jud Buechler , Randy Brown , Bill Wennington , Ron Harper and Luc Longley were key factors who rarely produced an astounding amount of points , but proved crucial via setting picks , rebounding , creating turnovers , et cetera . 
120	Before the beginning of the 1999 season , Phil Jackson decided to retire , setting off a chain reaction that resulted in most of the team , including Jordan and Pippen , leaving the Bulls . 
121	With no foundation of youth to build upon , the Bulls would be lottery-bound for the next six seasons . 
122	thumbright215pxThe Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy . 
123	The San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers have combined to win 11 of the last 13 Western Conference titles and nine NBA Championships during this period . 
124	In the 1999 NBA Finals Championship the San Antonio Spurs dominated the playoffs and finished with a 15–2 post-season mark , including sweeps of the Portland Trail Blazers and Lakers . 
125	With a defensive squad led by big men David Robinson and Tim Duncan , San Antonio 's 84.7 
126	points allowed per game was the fewest average points allowed in the post-season in the last 30 years . 
127	September 2007 In the Finals that year , the Spurs held the New York Knicks , the first # 8 seed team to reach the finals in NBA History , to an average of 79.8 
128	points per game . 
129	From 2000&ndash ;2002 , the Los Angeles Lakers , led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal , won the NBA Finals in dominating performances . 
130	O'Neal won the finals MVP all three times . 
131	The first championship came at the expense of the Indiana Pacers , whom the Lakers defeated in 6 games . 
132	During their 2001 postseason run , the Lakers swept their first 3 series and won the Finals in 5 games , finishing with a unprecedented 15–1 record . 
133	They were particularly dominating in the 2002 Finals , as they kept the lead almost the entire time in each game ; only for a short while after the beginning of Game 4 did the New Jersey Nets gain any significant lead in a game . 
134	The Lakers sweep of the Nets was the first sweep in the Finals since Houston swept Orlando in the 1995 Finals . 
135	However , the Lakers ' streak of championships ended with a loss to the Spurs 2003 conference semifinals . 
136	The 2003 NBA Finals marked the first championship contested between two former ABA teams , the San Antonio Spurs and the New Jersey Nets . 
137	The Spurs defeated the Nets and in 6 games . 
138	In the series clinching game , Tim Duncan was two blocks short of recording the first quadruple-double in NBA Finals history , finishing with 22 points , 20 rebounds , 10 assists , and 8 blocks . 
139	In the 2004 offseason , veteran stars Gary Payton and Karl Malone signed with the Lakers . 
140	Along with Bryant and O'Neal , they formed what many expected to be one of the best teams in NBA history . 
141	The Lakers were the clear favorites to win the NBA championship . 
142	However , the Detroit Pistons , under coach Larry Brown and led by defensive star Ben Wallace and offensive floor general Chauncey Billups , upset the Lakers in five games to become the first Eastern Conference team since the Bulls of the Michael Jordan era to win the NBA championship . 
143	The Spurs would go on to win two more titles in 2005 and 2007 . 
144	In the 2005 series , the Spurs defeated the Pistons , in a battle of the previous two NBA champions , in seven games . 
145	Tim Duncan won his third Finals MVP award that year . 
146	The Spurs dominated the 2007 Finals , sweeping the LeBron James -led Cleveland Cavaliers . 
147	Tony Parker was named MVP of this series , becoming the first European-born player to win NBA Finals MVP . 
148	Between these two Spurs ' titles , the 2006 NBA Finals featured the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks . 
149	It was the first NBA Finals since 1971 that had both Western and Eastern Conference champions making their first Finals appearance in franchise history . 
150	Led by upcoming star and Finals MVP Dwyane Wade , legendary coach Pat Riley and veteran superstar Shaquille O'Neal , Most agree that the turning point of the series was in Game 3 , when the Heat overcame a 13-point deficit with less than 6 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter to win 98–96 . 
151	The comeback was led by Dwyane Wade 's 12 points in the final six minutes and a clutch outside jumpshot by once-perennial all-star Gary Payton , who was appearing in his third NBA finals . 
152	In 2008 , the Eastern Conference was represented by the revamped Boston Celtics , and the Western Conference by the Los Angeles Lakers . 
153	Renewing the teams ' fierce rivalry of the 1980s , this marks the 11th time that these two teams have met in the Finals , the last such meeting happening in 1987 . 
154	The Celtics were led by their " Big Three " superstars : Long-time Celtic and Finals MVP Paul Pierce , and first year Celtics Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett . 
155	The Lakers would bounce back from their 2008 loss to win the title the in 2009 and 2010 . 
156	The 2010 series was a re-match against the Celtics . 
157	The Lakers trailed this series 3-2 before winning the final two games at home . 
158	This marked the first time in the history of the Celtics franchise that they lost a game seven in the NBA Finals . 
159	Kobe Bryant was named Finals MVP for both series , and this marked head coach Phil Jackson 's unprecedented 10th and 11th NBA title , passing Red Auerbach for the most NBA titles all time , and passing Auerbach and NHL coach Scotty Bowman for the most championships for a head coach in any major American sport . 
160	The 2011 NBA Finals were a rematch of the 2006 NBA Finals , pitting the Miami Heat against the Dallas Mavericks . 
161	The Mavericks defeated the Heat in six games , winning the title for the first time in franchise history . 
162	Dirk Nowitzki was named the Finals MVP.
