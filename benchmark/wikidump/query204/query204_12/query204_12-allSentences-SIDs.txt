6	0017-176X Golf Digest is a monthly golf magazine published by Condé Nast Publications in the United States . 
7	It is a generalist golf publication covering recreational golf and men 's and women 's competitive golf .

10	The Times company sold their magazine division to Condé Nast in 2001 . 
11	Since 1985 Golf Digest has produced biennial rankings of " America 's 100 Greatest Golf Courses " . 
12	The courses are voted on by a panel of several hundred golf experts . 
13	Although Pine Valley Golf Club has topped the list every year except 2001 , when Pebble Beach Golf Links ranked first , it was again outranked on the 2009-10 list - this time by Augusta National Golf Club . 
14	The magazine also produces lists of the best new courses , the best golf resorts and the best courses in each U.S. 
15	state . 
16	Before the " Greatest " rankings were introduced in 1985 Golf Digest produced lists called at different times America 's 100 Most Testing Courses and America 's 100 Greatest Tests of Golf . 
17	The top ten on the 2009-10 list are as follows : , ''Golf Digest , Accessed April 8 , 2009 The top ten on the 2007-08 list , published in May 2007 , was as follows : The top ten on the 2005-06 list , published in May 2005 , was as follows : Alongside the " 100 Greatest Courses " ranking , and using the same methodology , Golf Digest publishes a list of " America 's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses " .

21	For example , in a 1998 survey of Connecticut Public Golf Courses Golf Digest ranked Crestbrook Park Golf Course as one of Connecticut 's top public golf courses . 
22	The magazine also compiles a list of the leading courses outside the United States . 
23	This is created using information from national golf associations , plus votes by the same panelists supplemented by some additional ones with international knowledge .
