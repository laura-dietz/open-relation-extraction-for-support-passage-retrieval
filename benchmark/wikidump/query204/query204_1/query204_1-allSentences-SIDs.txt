9	Rules of Golf The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews 2007-11-07 PDF Play the ball as it lies , play the course as you find it , and if you cannot do either , do what is fair . 
10	But to do what is fair , you need to know the Rules of Golf . 
11	In addition to the rules golf adheres to a code of conduct , known as etiquette , which generally means playing the game with due respect for the golf course and other players . 
12	Etiquette is often seen as being as important to the sport as the rules themselves .

15	A guide to the rules of golf BBC Sport 2010-09-08 2008-07-17 Before the rules of golf were standardised golf clubs commonly had their own set of rules , which while broadly the same had subtle differences , such as allowing for the removal of loose impediments , e.g 
16	. 
17	leaves and small stones . 
18	In the late 19th century , most clubs began to align themselves with either the Society of St . 
19	Andrews Golfers , later the R&A , or the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith , later the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers . 
20	The earliest surviving written rules of golf were produced by the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith on 7 March 1744 , for a tournament played on 2 April . 
21	They were entitled " Articles and Laws in Playing at Golf " and consisted of 13 rules .

34	John Hutchinson 2010-09-08 The Rules of Golf and the Rules of Amateur Status is published every two years by the governing bodies of golf ( R&A/USGA ) to define how the game is to be played . 
35	The Rules have been published jointly in this manner since 1952 , although the code was not completely uniform until 2000 ( with mostly minor revisions to Appendix I ) . 
36	The Rules Committee of The R&A , which was spun off from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 2004 , has responsibility for upkeep and application of the rules worldwide except in the United States and Mexico , which are the responsibility of the United States Golf Association ( USGA ) . 
37	The term " Rules " can be said to include the following : Note that while the USGA defines its own handicapping and course rating system , the R&A defers this responsibility to the appropriate national governing bodies . 
38	The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews is a private golf club run for the benefit of its members . 
39	As such , since 2004 it has passed responsibility of publishing the rules to a private company , R&A Rules Ltd , operating under the stewardship of the golf club . 
40	In 2004 , the University of Chicago Press published a plain-language translation of this book . 
41	It was entitled The Rules of Golf in Plain English , by the lexicographer Bryan A. 
42	Garner and USGA rules official Jeffrey S. 
43	Kuhn . 
44	The purpose was to make the rules more accessible than the official version , which is pervasively legalistic and opaque . 
45	September 2010 The biggest change that came with the 2008&ndash ;2011 edition was a new rule about clubheads not having too much 'spring ' effect . 
46	This has led to the publishing of lists of conforming and non-conforming drivers . 
47	In 2010 a new rule governing grooves came into force for professional and high level amateur competition . 
48	The change was made in order to decrease the amount of back spin that players were able to produce , particularly from the rough . 
49	However , due to a previous legal settlement with Ping following an earlier rule change in the early 1990s , their Eye 2 irons , which were otherwise non-conforming , were deemed legal . 
50	This led to a controversy in the early stages of the 2010 PGA Tour season when Phil Mickelson used these irons .
