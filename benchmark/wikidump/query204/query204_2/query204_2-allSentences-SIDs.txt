17	?_r=1&scp=1&sq=USGA&st=nyt&oref=slogin The New York Times The New York Times Company 2008-05-26 2008-07-09 The Bob Jones Award is the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf . 
18	The inaugural award was given in 1955 . 
19	The USGA was originally formed in 1894 to resolve the question of a national amateur championship . 
20	Earlier that year , the Newport Country Club and Saint Andrew 's Golf Club , Yonkers _ New York , both declared the winners of their tournaments the "national amateur champion . 
21	" That autumn , delegates from Newport , St . 
22	Andrew 's , The Country Club , Chicago Golf Club , and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club met in New York City to form a national governing body , which would administer the championship and also the Rules of Golf for the country . 
23	On December 22 , 1894 , the Amateur Golf Association of the United States was officially formed , and was shortly thereafter renamed the " United States Golf Association . 
24	" Theodore Havemeyer was the first president , and the U.S. 
25	Amateur trophy is named in his honor . 
26	The first U.S. 
27	Amateur was held in 1895 at the Newport Country Club , with Charles B. 
28	Macdonald ( who was runner-up at both of the previous year 's tournaments ) winning the championship . 
29	The first U.S. 
30	Open was held the following day , almost as an afterthought . 
31	It was not until 1898 that the two events were held at separate clubs . 
32	Today , the USGA administers 13 separate national championships ; ten of which are expressly for amateurs . 
33	The USGA gradually expanded its membership from the original five clubs . 
34	There were 267 club members in 1910 , and 1,138 clubs by 1932 . 
35	Membership fell off during the Great Depression and World War II , but recovered by 1947 . 
36	By 1980 there were over 5,000 clubs , and today membership exceeds 9,700 .

49	2008-04-18 The USGA organizes or co-organizes the following competitions : An "open " golf championship is one which both professionals and amateurs may enter . 
50	In practice , such events are always won by professionals nowadays . 
51	The two leading opens in the U.S. 
52	are : The USGA also conducts the U.S. 
53	Senior Open for competitors 50 and over . 
54	This is one of the five majors recognized by the world 's dominant tour for golfers 50 and over , the Champions Tour . 
55	The overwhelming majority of the competitors play regularly on the Champions Tour . 
56	Many of the remaining players compete on the Champions Tour 's European counterpart , the European Seniors Tour , which recognizes the U.S. 
57	Senior Open as one of its three majors . 
58	Although a women 's senior tour ( with a lower age limit of 45 instead of 50 ) , now known as the Legends Tour , has existed since 2001 , the USGA has not yet created a Senior Women 's Open . 
59	Professional golf in the U.S. 
60	is mainly run by the PGA Tour , the LPGA , and the PGA of America . 
61	However , the USGA is at the heart of amateur golf in the country and organizes the 10 national amateur championships . 
62	The leading events are open to all age groups , but are usually won by golfers in their early twenties who are working towards a career in professional tournament golf : There are two championships for players under age 18 : And two for senior golfers : Because the U.S. 
63	Amateur and U.S. 
64	Women 's Amateur became increasingly dominated by future tournament professionals , two national championships were added in the 1980s for " career amateurs " who were 25 years of age &amp; older : There are also two events for "public-course " golfers . 
65	Members of private golf clubs are excluded from these championships : The USGA men 's and women 's state team championships were first conducted in 1995 as a part of the USGA 's Centennial celebration . 
66	The two championships were conducted biennially in odd numbered years through 2009 . 
67	Starting in 2010 the men 's championship will be conducted in even numbered years and the women 's championship in odd numbered years . 
68	According to NCAA rules , college golfers are not eligible . 
69	The USGA co-organizes two biennial amateur team competitions between the United States and a joint team representing Great Britain and Ireland ( in political terms , the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland ) : Through its membership of the International Golf Federation the USGA is involved in the administration of the two " World Amateur Team Championships " , which are played biennially in even-numbered years . 
70	Only seven golfers have won more than one USGA individual event in the same year : Five people have won three different USGA individual events in their careers : Thirty-seven other people have won two different USGA individual events in their careers : Note : Multiple winners of individual events can be found in that event 's article . 
71	The USGA partnered with World Golf Tour in 2009 to co-host the first annual Virtual USGA Championship online . 
72	The Virtual U.S. 
73	Open attracted hundreds of thousands of players from more than 180 countries . 
74	The first place winner took home a replica of the U.S. 
75	Open trophy and won a trip for two to Pebble Beach for the next year’s event .
