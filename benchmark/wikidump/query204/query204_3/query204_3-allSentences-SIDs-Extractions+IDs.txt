The goal of getting the ball into the hole ( "holing " the ball ) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of long grass called 'rough ' (usually found alongside fairways ) which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it , bunker ( or sand traps ) , and water hazard . 	116	query204_Golf\S\116
