13	9 October 2009 23 September 2010 Golf is a precision club and ball sport , in which competing players ( or golfers ) use many types of club to hit ball into a series of holes on a golf course using the fewest number of strokes . 
14	It is one of the few ball game that does not require a standardized playing area . 
15	Instead , the game is played on golf " courses " , each of which features a unique design , although courses typically consist of either nine or 18 holes . 
16	Golf is defined , in the rules of golf , as "playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules . 
17	" Golf competition is generally played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known simply as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes during a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . 
18	History of golf While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland , the game 's ancient origins are unclear and much debated . 
19	Some historians Brasch , Rudolph How did sports begin ? : A look at the origins of man at play McKay 1970 Brasch , Rudolph How did sports begin ? : A look at the origins of man at play McKay 1970 trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica , in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball . 
20	One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent , during the first century BC , and eventually evolved into the modern game .

39	In addition , kolven ( a game involving a ball and curved bats ) was played annually in Loenen , Netherlands , beginning in 1297 , to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V , a year earlier .

60	Golf course A golf course consists of a series of holes , each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area , fairway , rough and other hazard , and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin ( normally a flagstick ) and cup . 
61	The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty , or to allow for putting in the case of the green . 
62	While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green , some holes may bend either to the left or to the right . 
63	This is commonly called a "dogleg" , in reference to a dog 's knee . 
64	The hole is called a "dogleg left " if the hole angles leftwards and "dogleg right " if it bends right . 
65	Sometimes , a hole 's direction may bend twice ; this is called a "double dogleg" . 
66	A typical golf course consists of 18 holes , but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes .

104	Why Does Golf Have 18 Holes ? 6 May 2010 http ://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/golf-good-question-93041254.html 
105	Why Does Golf Have 18 Holes ? 6 May 2010 thumbright200px1=teeing ground _ 2=water hazard _ 3=rough _ 4=out of bounds _ 5=sand bunker _ 6=water hazard _ 7=fairway _ 8=putting green _ 9=flagstick _ 10=hole Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order . 
106	A 'round ' typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout . 
107	On a nine-hole course , a standard round consists of two consecutive nine-hole rounds . 
108	Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground ( also called the tee box , or simply the tee ) . 
109	When this initial stroke ( or 'shot ' ) is required to be long due to the length of the hole , it is usual ( but not required ) for a golfer to suspend ( or 'tee-up ' ) the ball on a tee prior to striking it . 
110	A tee in this last sense is a small peg which can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high . 
111	This elevation is at the discretion of the golfer . 
112	Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material ; the ball may even be teed on a mound of grass or dirt ( at one time a small pile of sand placed by the golfer was routinely used and sand was provided at teeing grounds for golfers ' use ) . 
113	When the initial shot on a hole is a long-distance shot intended to move the ball a great distance down the fairway , this shot is commonly called a 'drive ' . 
114	Shorter holes generally are initiated with shorter clubs called iron . 
115	Once the ball comes to rest , the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a 'lay-up' , an 'approach' , a 'pitch' , or a ' chip ' , until the ball reaches the green , where he or she then ' putts ' the ball into the hole ( commonly called " sinking the putt " ) . 
116	The goal of getting the ball into the hole ( "holing " the ball ) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of long grass called 'rough ' (usually found alongside fairways ) which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it , bunker ( or sand traps ) , and water hazard . 
117	In most forms of gameplay , each player plays his or her ball until it is holed . 
118	Players can walk to their next shot or drive in golf cart over the course . 
119	The game can be played either individually or in groups and sometimes accompanied by caddie , who carry and manage the players ' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course .

168	1 October 2007 Essentially , anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction , or played golf for money , is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs . 
169	However , amateur golfers may receive expenses which comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status . 
170	In addition to the officially printed rules , golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette . 
171	Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety , fairness , pace of play , and a player 's obligation to contribute to the care of the course . 
172	Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules , players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone 's playing experience . 
173	Penalties are incurred in certain situations . 
174	They are counted towards a player 's score as if there were extra swing( s ) at the ball . 
175	Strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one 's ball into an unplayable situation . 
176	A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance ( Rule 27–1 ) . 
177	A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player 's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move ( Rule 18–2 ) . 
178	If a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball ( Rule 19–2 ) or hits a fellow golfer 's ball with a putt ( Rule 19–5 ) , the player incurs a two-stroke penalty . 
179	Most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification . 
180	Disqualification could be from cheating , signing for a lower score , or from rule infractions that lead to improper play . 
181	September 2010 September 2010 Golf equipment thumbrightAWood ( golf)woodpositioned ready to be swung and to strike agolf ball Golf club are used to hit the golf ball . 
182	Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance ( or 'grip ' ) on the top end and a club head on the bottom . 
183	Long clubs , which have a lower amount of degreed loft , are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance , and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance . 
184	Typically , the actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter , depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball . 
185	The 'driver ' is the largest-headed and longest club . 
186	Wood are slightly shorter but still comparatively large-headed clubs , used for long-distance fairway shots . 
187	Woods are now typically made of metal ; the traditional name remains in general use but is gradually being replaced by the term "fairway metal" . 
188	April 2011 Next shorter in length are the iron , the most numerous and versatile class used for a wide variety of shots . 
189	Hybrid embody the characteristics of both woods and irons in varying degrees and are increasingly being used in preference to long irons in many places because they are easier for the average golfer to use . 
190	Finally , the putter is used to roll the ball across the green into the cup . 
191	A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player 's bag at one time during a stipulated round . 
192	The choice of clubs is at the golfer 's discretion , although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules . 
193	( Clubs which meet these parameters are usually called 'conforming '. 
194	) Violation of these rules can result in disqualification . 
195	The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course , and which club is used to accomplish the shot , are always completely at the discretion of the golfer ; in other words , there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot . 
196	Golf ball are spherical , usually white ( although other colors are allowed ) , and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion , preventing "boundary layer " separation ,thereby allowing the ball to fly farther .

208	Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction , thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots . 
209	A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player 's other or personal equipment . 
210	Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees , balls , and gloves . 
211	Golf bags can be carried , pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play . 
212	Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying , and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest .

214	Golf stroke mechanics Understanding the golf stroke is easier if one first understands the golfer 's role . 
215	The golfer does not "hit the ball" . 
216	The golfer 's role is to swing the club , which then strikes the ball . 
217	Golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target . 
218	At address the body and club are positioned parallel to the target line . 
219	The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters , narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods . 
220	The ball is positioned in the centre of the player 's stance for short irons and putters , more to the front for middle irons and even more for long irons and woods . 
221	The golfer chooses a golf club , grip , and stroke appropriate to the distance : Par (score ) A hole is classified by its par , meaning the number of strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole . 
222	For example , a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par-4 hole in two strokes : one from the tee ( the 'drive ' ) and another , second , stroke to the green ( the 'approach' ) ; and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par . 
223	This would be termed a 'green in regulation ' ( GIR ) . 
224	A hole is either a par-3 , −4 or −5 . 
225	Par-6 holes are extremely rare .

231	Definition of Par About.com 
232	Kelley , Brent 8 November 2007 The key factor for classifying the par of a hole is the distance from the tee to the green . 
233	A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards ( 225 m ) in length , with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards ( 225–434 m ) , and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards ( 435 m ) . 
234	The rare par-6s can stretch well over 650 yards ( 595 m ) . 
235	The gradient of the hole can also affect its par . 
236	If the tee-to-green distance on a hole is predominantly downhill , it will play shorter than its physical length and may be given a lower par ; the opposite is true for uphill holes . 
237	Par ratings are also affected by factors such as the placement of hazards or the shape of the green , which can affect the play of a hole by requiring an extra stroke to avoid playing into hazards .

252	Golf FAQ : What is Slope Rating ? Kelley , Brent About.com 
253	8 November 2007 In every form of play , the goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible . 
254	A hole in one ( or an 'ace ' ) occurs when a golfer sinks his ball into the cup with his first stroke from the tee . 
255	Common scores for a hole also have specific terms . 
256	In match play , two players ( or two teams ) play each hole as a separate contest against each other . 
257	The party with the lower score wins that hole , or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is 'halved ' ( or tied ) . 
258	The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other . 
259	In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played , the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead , and the remainder of the holes are not played . 
260	For example , if one party already has a lead of six holes , and only five holes remain to be played on the course , the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won " 6 &amp; 5" . 
261	At any given point , if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining , the party leading the match is said to be 'dormie ' , and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes , thereby winning the match , or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player 's opponent winning all remaining holes . 
262	When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played , it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead . 
263	In stroke play , the score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score , and the player with the lowest score wins . 
264	Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers . 
265	If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament , a playoff takes place between all tied players . 
266	Playoffs are either sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes , anywhere from three to a full 18 . 
267	In sudden death , a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match . 
268	If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes , then play continues in sudden death format , where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament . 
269	In a skins game , golfers compete on each hole , as a separate contest . 
270	Played for prize money on the professional level or as a means of a wager for amateurs , a 'skin' , or the prize money assigned to each hole , carries over to subsequent holes if the hole is tied ( or halved ) . 
271	If you come to the end of the round and there are still skins left over , play continues until the final skin has been decided . 
272	September 2011 In a 9-Point game three players compete for points on each hole . 
273	The player with the most points at the end of the round wins the game . 
274	Each hole is worth a total of 9 points . 
275	The player with the best score ( lowest ) on the hole wins 5 points , the player with the second best score earns 3 points and the player with the worst gets 1 point . 
276	In the event of a tie for the best score on a hole the two best players will each get 4 and the worst player gets 1 point . 
277	If everyone ties then each player gets 3 points on that hole . 
278	If there is a tie for the second best score on a hole then the player with the best score gets 5 points and the other two each get 2 points . 
279	If a player gets a birdie they will receive an additional 2 points on that hole . 
280	If a player gets an eagle , they will receive an additional 3 points on that hole . 
281	Under the Stableford system the player gains points for the score achieved on each hole of the round or tournament ( 1 point for a bogey , 2 points for a par , 3 points for a birdie , 4 points for an eagle , and so on ) . 
282	The points achieved for each hole of the round or tournament are added together to produce the total points score . 
283	The player with the highest score wins . 
284	There are also popular unofficial variations on team play : Handicap ( golf ) A handicap is a numerical measure of an amateur golfer 's ability to play golf over the course of 18 holes . 
285	Handicaps can be applied either for stroke play or match play competition . 
286	In either competition , a handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that a player will achieve on an above-average day ( i .e 
287	. 
288	, when playing well ) . 
289	In stroke play competition , the competitor 's handicap is subtracted from their total gross score at the end of the round , to calculate a net score against which standings are calculated . 
290	In match play competition , handicap strokes are assigned on a hole-by-hole basis , according to the handicap rating of each hole ( which is provided by the course ) . 
291	The hardest holes on the course receive the most handicap strokes , with the easiest holes receiving the least handicap strokes . 
292	Calculating a handicap is often complicated , but essentially it is representative of the average over par of a number of a player 's previous above-average rounds , adjusted for course difficulty . 
293	Legislation regarding the calculation of handicaps differs among countries . 
294	For example , handicap rules may include the difficulty of the course the golfer is playing on by taking into consideration factors such as the number of bunkers , the length of the course , the difficulty and slopes of the greens , the width of the fairways , and so on . 
295	Handicap systems are not used in professional golf . 
296	Professional golfers often score several strokes below par for a round and thus have a calculated handicap of 0 or less , meaning that their handicap results in the addition of strokes to their round score . 
297	Someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often called a 'scratch golfer '. 
298	thumbright200pxPart of a golf course in western India . 
299	In 2005 , Golf Digest calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita , starting with the best endowed were : Scotland , New Zealand , Australia , Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland , Canada , Wales , United States , Sweden , and England ( countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded ) . 
300	Apart from Sweden , all of these countries have English as the majority language , but the number of courses in new territories is increasing rapidly . 
301	The most notable example of this phenomenon is the expansion of golf in China . 
302	The first golf course in China opened in 1984 , but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country . 
303	For the last several years , development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned ( with the exception of the island province of Hainan ) , but the number of courses has nonetheless tripled since 2004 ; the "ban " has been easily evaded with the government 's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans .

316	Professional golfer The majority of professional golfer work as club or teaching professionals ( 'pros' ) , and only compete in local competitions . 
317	A small elite of professional golfers are 'tournament pros ' who compete full-time on international 'tours ' . 
318	Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddie or with a general interest in the game , finding employment at golf course and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession . 
319	These programs include independent institutions and universities , and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification . 
320	thumbrightIndoorGolf course# Putting greenputting greenfor practice and instruction Golf instruction Golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf . 
321	Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability , but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game . 
322	In some countries , golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association . 
323	Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right . 
324	Instructors use a combination of physical conditioning , mental visualization , classroom sessions , club fitting , driving range instruction , on-course play under real conditions , and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf . 
325	Professional golf tours There are at least twenty professional golf tours , each run by a PGA or an independent tour organization , which is responsible for arranging events , finding sponsors , and regulating the tour . 
326	Typically a tour has "members " who are entitled to compete in most of its events , and also invites non-members to compete in some of them . 
327	Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive , and most professional golfers never achieve it . 
328	Perhaps the most widely known tour is the PGA Tour , which tends to attract the strongest fields , outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events . 
329	This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least US$ 800,000 . 
330	The European Tour , which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America , ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige . 
331	Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour . 
332	The other leading men 's tours include the Japan Golf Tour , the Asian Tour ( Asia outside Japan ) , the PGA Tour of Australasia , and the Sunshine Tour ( for southern Africa , primarily South Africa ) . 
333	The Japan , Australasian , Sunshine , PGA , and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world 's main tours , the International Federation of PGA Tours , founded in 1996 . 
334	The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999 . 
335	The Canadian Tour became an associate member of the Federation in 2000 , and the Tour de las Américas ( Latin America ) became an associate member of the Federation in 2007 . 
336	The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 which saw eleven new tours become full members – the Canadian Tour , Tour de las Américas , China Golf Association , the Korea Professional Golfers ' Association , Professional Golf Tour of India , and the operators of all six major women 's tours worldwide . 
337	The OneAsia Tour , founded in 2009 , is not a member of the Federation , but was founded as a joint venture of the Australasia , China , Japan , and Korean tours . 
338	All of the men 's tours that are Federation members , except the China and India tours , offer points in the Official World Golf Ranking ( OWGR ) to players who place sufficiently high in their events . 
339	The OneAsia Tour also offers ranking points . 
340	Golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players . 
341	There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over , arguably the best known of which is the U.S. 
342	-based Champions Tour . 
343	There are six principal tours for women , each based in a different country or continent . 
344	The most prestigious of these is the United States based LPGA Tour . 
345	All of the principal tours offer points in the Women 's World Golf Rankings for high finishers in their events . 
346	All of the leading professional tours for under-50 players have an official developmental tour , in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season . 
347	Examples include the Nationwide Tour , which feeds to the PGA Tour , and the Challenge Tour , which is the developmental tour of the European Tour . 
348	The Nationwide and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points .

380	Open , the U.S. 
381	Amateur , the Open Championship , and the British Amateur . 
382	thumbright125pxLorena Ochoa ; the recently retired number one female golfer _ pictured here in 2007 . 
383	Women 's major golf championships Women 's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors . 
384	The list of majors recognised by the dominant women 's tour , the LPGA Tour in the U.S. 
385	, has changed several times over the years , with the last change in 2001 . 
386	Like the PGA Tour , the ( U.S. 
387	) LPGA There are several bodies known as the "LPGA" , each based in a different country or continent . 
388	The U.S. 
389	LPGA is the only one without a geographic identifier in its name , as it was the first to be founded . 
390	Typically , if the term "LPGA " is used without an identifier , it refers to the U.S. 
391	body . 
392	has four majors : the Kraft Nabisco Championship , the LPGA Championship , the U.S. 
393	Women 's Open and the Women 's British Open . 
394	Only the last of these is also recognised by the Ladies European Tour . 
395	The other event that it recognises as a major is the Evian Masters , which is currently sanctioned by the LPGA only as a regular tour event but will become a major on that tour in 2013 . 
396	However , the significance of this is limited , as the LPGA is far more dominant in women 's golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men 's golf . 
397	For example , the BBC has been known to use the U.S. 
398	definition of "women 's majors " without qualifying it . 
399	Also , the Ladies ' Golf Union , the governing body for women 's golf in the UK and Republic of Ireland , has stated on its official website that the Women 's British Open is " the only Women 's Major to be played outside the U.S. 
400	" http ://www.lgu.org/championships/women__s_british_open/ 
401	Women 's British Open breaks new ground at St Andrews Ladies ' Golf Union 12 August 2007 http ://www.lgu.org/championships/women__s_british_open/ 
402	Women 's British Open breaks new ground at St Andrews Ladies ' Golf Union 12 August 2007 For many years , the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U.S. 
403	, but that changed beginning in 2008 , when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship . 
404	The second-richest women 's tour , the LPGA of Japan Tour , does not recognise any of the U.S. 
405	LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors ( historically three , since 2008 four ) . 
406	However , these events attract little notice outside Japan . 
407	Senior major golf championships Senior ( aged fifty and over ) men 's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors . 
408	The list of senior majors on the U.S. 
409	-based Champions Tour has changed over the years , but always by expansion . 
410	The Champions Tour now recognises five majors : the Senior PGA Championship , the United States Senior Open , the Senior British Open Championship , The Tradition and the Senior Players Championship . 
411	Of the five events , the Senior PGA is by far the oldest , having been founded in 1937 . 
412	The other events all date from the 1980s , when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era , such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player , reached the relevant age . 
413	The Senior British Open was not recognised as a major by the Champions Tour until 2003 . 
414	The European Seniors Tour recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors . 
415	However , the Champions Tour is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U.S. 
416	LPGA is in global women 's golf .

418	The drive is used on the teeing ground to tee-off long distances ; The approach is used in long- to mid-distance shots ; The chip is used for relatively short-distance shots around the green . 
419	The goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green allowing it to roll out towards the hole . 
420	The putt is used in short-distance shots on or near the green . 
421	The goal of the putt is to get the ball in the hole . 
422	Foursome : defined in Rule 29 , this is played between two teams of two players each , in which each team has only one ball and players alternate playing it .

424	On the second hole , ' B ' will tee off ( regardless who played the last putt on the first hole ) , then ' A ' plays the second shot , and so on . 
425	Foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play .
