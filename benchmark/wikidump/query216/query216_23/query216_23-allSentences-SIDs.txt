2	Pictures Sony Pictures ( International ) 102 minutes 2006 9 1 English $ 40 million $ 38,755,073 The Wicker Man is a 2006 American remake of the 1973 British film of the same title . 
3	It was written and directed by Neil LaBute , based on a screenplay by Anthony Shaffer , and stars Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn . 
4	The film was poorly received by critics , and Robin Hardy , co-creator and director of the original British film , disassociated himself from it . 
5	Edward Malus ( Nicolas Cage ) , an American policeman , receives news from his ex-fiancée , Willow Woodward ( Kate Beahan ) , that her daughter , Rowan ( Erika Shaye Gair ) , is missing . 
6	He gets a pilot ( Matthew Walker ) to take him to an island off the coast of Washington state where a group of neo-pagans live . 
7	The island is led by Sister Summersisle ( Ellen Burstyn ) , an elderly woman who is treated like a goddess . 
8	The economy of the island relies on the production of local honey , which Malus learns has been down recently . 
9	Malus asks the villagers about Rowan , but they give him evasive answers . 
10	He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood , then he finds a fresh , unmarked grave in the churchyard . 
11	The grave turns out to only contain a burned doll , but Malus finds Rowan 's sweater in the churchyard . 
12	At the village school , teacher Sister Rose ( Molly Parker ) tries to prevent Malus from seeing the class register . 
13	When he sees that Rowan 's name has been crossed out he becomes enraged at the teacher 's and Rowan 's classmates ' lies . 
14	Rose demands Malus to talk outside and after a short discussion of the island people 's view of death and , Rose explains that Rowan is " not missing" . 
15	Malus asks how Rowan died and Rose tells him first that " she 'll burn to death" . 
16	When Malus catches the tense she uses , the " she 'll" , Rose corrects herself quickly and rushes herself back to her class . 
17	On the day of the ritual , Malus frantically searches the village for Rowan . 
18	He attacks Sister Beech ( Diane Delano ) , who has a bear costume for the ritual . 
19	Malus steals her costume and joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle . 
20	The parade ends at the site of the festival . 
21	Rowan is tied to a large tree , about to be burned . 
22	Malus rescues Rowan and they run away through the woods , but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle . 
23	Sister Summersisle thanks Rowan for her help , and Malus realizes that the search for Rowan was a trap . 
24	The villagers attack Malus and overpower him ( in the "alternate ending " version , the scene is extended , showing the villagers as they break his legs and place a mask of bees on his head ) . 
25	The women carry him to a giant wicker man and shut him inside . 
26	Rowan sets fire to the wicker man and Malus is sacrificed . 
27	The crowd chants " The drone must die ! 
28	" , believing that Malus 's sacrifice will restore their honey production . 
29	The last scene is shown with Willow and Sister Honey ( Leelee Sobieski ) going into a bar and talking with two male police officers ( James Franco and Jason Ritter ) . 
30	The women invite them to go home with them , presumably in hopes of luring them just as Malus was . 
31	Screaming from Edward Malus can be heard as the film fades into dark ( both scenes are absent from the DVD release ) . 
32	The original film 's director , Robin Hardy , had expressed skepticism over the Hollywood remake , and had his lawyers make Warner Bros. 
33	remove his name from the remake 's promotional material . 
34	According to Hardy , he was given writing credit for the screenplay , when he had not received any for the original . 
35	Christopher Lee , who played Lord Summerisle in the original film , said about the remake : " What do I think of it being played by a woman , when it was played by a man in 1972 , as part of a Scottish pagan community , and now it 's played by a woman with the same name ? What do I think of it ? Nothing . 
36	There 's nothing to say .
