15	January&nbsp;4 , 2011 Development on the film began in 2000 when the spec script by screenwriter Bragi F. 
16	Schut was purchased by MGM . 
17	The project moved from MGM to Columbia Pictures to Relativity Media , where the film was finally produced by Charles Roven and Alex Gartner . 
18	Filming took place primarily in Austria , Hungary and Croatia . 
19	Season of the Witch was released on January 7 , 2011 in the United States , Canada and several other territories . 
20	The film received negative reviews but was a moderate box office success . 
21	Set in the 14th century , three women accused of witchcraft are hanged by a priest . 
22	The priest performs a ritual to prevent the bodies from coming back to life . 
23	While successfully completing the ritual for the first two of the bodies , the third takes on a demonic appearance and kills the priest . 
24	Meanwhile , Teutonic Knights Behmen von Bleibruck ( Nicolas Cage ) and Felson ( Ron Perlman ) are engaged in a crusade , taking part in several different battles throughout the 1330s and eventually taking part in the Smyrniote crusades . 
25	After witnessing the massacre of civilians during the 1344 capture of Smyrna , the two knights choose to desert the Order and the crusade and return to Germany . 
26	While traveling through Styria , they encounter the grotesque sight of people infected with the Black Death and soon discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague . 
27	Behmen and Felson enter the medieval town of Marburg , the German name for Maribor (once part of Styria , now in Slovenia ) . 
28	The two try to conceal their identity as deserters , but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen 's sword . 
29	He and Felson are then arrested . 
30	They are taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise ( Christopher Lee ) , who is infected with the plague . 
31	The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery where an elite group of monks reside . 
32	These monks are capable of determining if the girl is truly a witch . 
33	If she is found guilty , the monks know a sacred ritual that can cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe . 
34	The two knights agree under the condition that she will be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them are dropped . 
35	The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest Debelzeq ( Stephen Campbell Moore ) ; Kay von Wollenbarth ( Robert Sheehan ) , a young altar boy who wants to become a knight like his deceased father ; Eckhart ( Ulrich Thomsen ) , a knight whose family were killed by the plague ; and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar ( Stephen Graham ) who is serving as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon . 
36	The witch , a young girl later identified as Anna ( Claire Foy ) , shows hatred towards Debelzeq and forms a bond with Behmen . 
37	Shortly after setting off , the group camp for the night . 
38	Eckhart volunteers to watch the witch for the first night . 
39	After a while , Debelzeq comes to relieve Eckhart , who decides to remain with him . 
40	He tells Debelzeq about his daughter Mila , who resembled Anna . 
41	When Eckhart gets up to leave , Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with the priest . 
42	She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage . 
43	She escapes and flees toward a nearby village . 
44	The search for her leads the group to a mass grave , where Eckhart has visions of his dead daughter . 
45	Running after the visions , he impales himself on Kay 's sword and dies . 
46	When they recapture her , the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzeq . 
47	However the group become less trusting of Anna . 
48	The group manage to cross a rickety rope bridge , during which Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand , showing an unnatural strength . 
49	The group enter the dark forest called Wormwood , where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so the group can go home , only to be stopped by the others . 
50	Anna appears to summon wolves , who chase the group and kill Hagamar . 
51	An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna , but is stopped by Debelzeq and Felson , who point out that the monastery is in sight . 
52	Arriving at the monastery , the men find all of the monks have been killed by the plague but locate the Key of Solomon , an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil . 
53	The men confront Anna , with Debelzeq beginning to perform a ritual used on witches . 
54	However , as Anna begins precisely recanting stories from Behmen 's past , Debelzeq comes to the realization that she is not a witch , and begins frantically performing an exorcism . 
55	However , the demon that is possessing Anna reveals itself and melts the metal . 
56	The demon effortlessly fights off the knights , but when Debelzeq throws a vial of holy water on it , it flies out of sight . 
57	As the men search for the demon , they come to the realization that it is n't trying to escape , but trying to destroy the book so that nothing can stop it . 
58	When they find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book , the demon appears , destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks ' bodies to use as weapons . 
59	The three men fight the possessed monks while Debelzeq continues the exorcism ritual . 
60	During the fight , the demon kills Debelzeq , then proceeds to kill Felson . 
61	Kay picks up the book and continues the ritual , while Behmen continues fighting the demon . 
62	Behmen is mortally wounded during the fight , but Kay is able to finish the ritual and the demon is obliterated , freeing Anna . 
63	Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe and then dies of his wounds . 
64	Kay and Anna bury their fallen friends . 
65	Anna requests that Kay tell her about the men who saved her . 
66	They depart from the monastery with the book in hand .

82	January&nbsp;4 , 2011 January&nbsp;4 , 2011 The producers worked with director Dominic Sena to perform location shooting throughout Europe . 
83	They sought a 14th century castle to use as a setting for the story ; castles visited in Germany , Poland and the Czech Republic could not fit the period . 
84	With the film yet to be produced , the project eventually moved to Relativity Media , and Sena was officially attached to direct . 
85	Business and creative discussions led to avoiding too much violence or gore in the film so a broader audience could see it . 
86	Actor Nicolas Cage was considered for the starring role but was unavailable during the time of the location shooting . 
87	Cage eventually became available in 2008 and was cast in the role . 
88	He explained his interest , " I wanted to make movies that celebrated actors like Christopher Lee and Vincent Price , and the great Roger Corman classics that are unafraid to explore the paranormal and the supernatural . 
89	" The crew began production immediately after Cage finished Bad Lieutenant : Port of Call New Orleans ( 2009 ) . 
90	The film had a budget of approximately US$ 40 million , and much of the budget was covered by Relativity with pre-sales to distributors outside the United States .

173	Rogue Network December&nbsp;30 , 2010 January&nbsp;6 , 2011 For Season of the Witch , Tippett Studio designed the demon that manifests in the film 's denouement . 
174	The art directors researched woodcuts and other artwork for classic demonic appearances . 
175	The filmmakers requested an entity "lithe and feminine" , and the visual effects crew designed a demon that had " cloven feet , a dog ankle and a fawn leg" . 
176	Designing visual effects for the demon 's wings was the biggest challenge since wings tend to get in the way or do not move convincingly . 
177	The filmmakers also requested holes in the demon 's wings . 
178	The crew designed holes that appeared worn instead of ripped since ripped holes would require an added billowing effect .

183	Animation World Network January&nbsp;11 , 2011 January&nbsp;12 , 2011 The demon was also designed to have dark gray skin , which presented the crew a challenge in the film 's dark settings . 
184	Tippett 's Blair Clark said , " We played the skin like a rotten , mummy : nothing too moist , with a lot of wear marks on it . 
185	" The crew 's final visual effects shot was the death of the demon , and they researched previous films and terminology for how demons ' deaths have been designed . 
186	They drew inspiration from Hellboy ( 2004 ) where they focused on the buildup to the demon 's death . 
187	Clark said , " We built it over a series of shots so it does n't just happen in one shot . 
188	We had little patches on the demon that start to crack and result in a glow that looks like it 's burning from within . 
189	" Lionsgate scheduled Season of the Witch to be released on March&nbsp;19 , 2010 , but five weeks before the date , the studio decided to pull the film from release .
