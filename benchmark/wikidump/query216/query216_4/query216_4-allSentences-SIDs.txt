21	The last three dates on the page are in the near future .

24	On his way to pick up Caleb from school , Jonathan witnesses a major airplane crash . 
25	It is the date that the numbers predicted for the next disaster ; the unexplained numbers are the locations of the events .

118	SDCC Interview : Alex Proyas for Knowing Dark Horizons 6 August 2008 13 December 2008 He sought to capture a gritty and realistic look to the film , and his approach involved a continuous two-minute scene in which Cage 's character sees a plane crash and attempts to rescue passengers . 
119	The scene was an arduous task , taking two days to set up and two days to shoot . 
120	Proyas explained the goal , " I did that specifically to not let the artifice of visual effects and all the cuts and stuff we can do , get in the way of the emotion of the scene .

174	But the narrative corner into which this movie ... 
175	paints itself is a simultaneously silly and morbidly depressing one .
