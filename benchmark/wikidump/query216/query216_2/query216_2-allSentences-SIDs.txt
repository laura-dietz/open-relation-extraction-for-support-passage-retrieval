26	Irish Examiner July 27 , 2011 Cage 's mother is of German descent and his father was of Italian descent ( his paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino , and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda , Basilicata ) . 
27	Through his father , Cage is the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and actress Talia Shire , and the cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola , film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola , and actors Robert Carmine and Jason Schwartzman . 
28	Cage 's two brothers are New York radio personality Marc " The Cope " Coppola and director Christopher Coppola . 
29	He attended Beverly Hills High School , which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers . 
30	He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theatre , Film and Television . 
31	His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of Golden Boy . 
32	To avoid the appearance of nepotism as the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola , he changed his name early in his career to Nicolas Cage , inspired in part by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage . 
33	Since his minor role in the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High , with Sean Penn , Cage has appeared in a wide range of films , both mainstream and offbeat . 
34	He tried out for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle 's film The Outsiders , based on S.E. 
35	Hinton 's novel , but lost to Matt Dillon . 
36	He was also in Coppola 's films Rumble Fish and Peggy Sue Got Married . 
37	Other Cage roles included appearances in the acclaimed 1987 romantic-comedy Moonstruck , also starring Cher ; The Coen Brothers cult-classic comedy Raising Arizona ; David Lynch 's 1990 offbeat film Wild at Heart ; a lead role in Martin Scorsese 's 1999 New York City paramedic drama Bringing Out the Dead ; and Ridley Scott 's 2003 quirky drama Matchstick Men , in which he played an agoraphobic , mysophobic , obsessive-compulsive con artist with a tic disorder . 
38	Cage has been nominated twice for an Academy Award , winning once for his performance as a suicidal alcoholic in Leaving Las Vegas . 
39	His other nomination was for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman 's fictional twin Donald in Adaptation . 
40	Despite these successes , most of his lower-profile films have performed poorly at the box office compared to his mainstream action/adventure roles .

42	He took the lead role in the 2001 film Captain Corelli 's Mandolin and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part . 
43	In 2005 , two offbeat films he headlined , Lord of War and The Weather Man , failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his acting in those roles .

56	In early December 2006 , Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests . 
57	On The Dresden Files for the Sci-Fi Channel , Cage is listed as the executive producer . 
58	Cage said : " I feel I 've made a lot of movies already and I want to start exploring other opportunities that I can apply myself to , whether it 's writing or other interests that I may develop . 
59	" In November 2007 , Cage was spotted backstage at a Ring of Honor wrestling show in New York City researching his role for The Wrestler . 
60	The role was ultimately played by Mickey Rourke , who received an Academy Award nomination for his performance . 
61	Wrestler Director Darren Aronofsky , in an interview with slashfilm.com 
62	, said of Cage 's decision to leave the film that : " Nic was a complete gentleman , and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside . 
63	I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... 
64	you know , Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity , so he pulled himself out of the race . 
65	" thumbrightCage at the 66thVenice Film Festivalin September 2009 In 2008 , Cage appeared as Joe , a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok , in the film Bangkok Dangerous .

71	Also in 2009 , Cage starred in the film Bad Lieutenant : Port of Call New Orleans , directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog .

75	" This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes , who played his love interest in Ghost Rider . 
76	In 2010 , Cage starred in the period piece Season of the Witch , playing a 14th-century knight transporting a girl accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery , and The Sorcerer 's Apprentice , in which he played the sorcerer .

92	How often do you see the name of Nicolas Cage ? He should always be up there .
