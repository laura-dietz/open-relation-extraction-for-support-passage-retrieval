0	A no-carbohydrate diet ( no-carb diet ) is described as human carnivorism . 
1	It excludes dietary consumption of all carbohydrates and suggests fat as the main source of energy with sufficient protein . 
2	A no-carbohydrate diet is ketogenic , which means it causes the body to go into a state of ketosis ( converting dietary fat and body fat into ketone bodies and using them to fuel the entire body and up to 95 % of the brain . 
3	The remaining 5 % still runs on glucose which is adequately supplied by converting dietary protein via gluconeogenesis or by converting glycerol from the breakdown of fat ) . 
4	It uses mainly animal source foods and requires a high saturated fat intake . 
5	The earliest and primary proponent of an all animal-based diet was Vilhjalmur Stefansson , a Canadian explorer who lived with the Inuit for some time , and who witnessed their diet as essentially consisting of meat and fish , with very few carbohydrates - berries during the summer . 
6	Stefansson and a friend later volunteered for a one year experiment at Bellevue Hospital in New York to prove he could thrive on a diet of nothing but meat , meat fat and internal organs of animals .

21	87 3 651–668 His progress was closely monitored and experiments were done on his health throughout the year . 
22	At the end of the year , he did not show any symptoms of ill health ; he did not develop scurvy , which many scientists had expected to manifest itself only a few months into the diet due to the lack of vitamin C in muscle meat . 
23	However , Stefansson and his partner did not eat just muscle meat - they ate fat , raw brain , raw liver ( a significant source of vitamin C and others ) , and other varieties of offal . 
24	One of the first registries on No-carbohydrate diets was in 1860 when English casket maker William Banting was prompted to lose weight and decided to write “Letter on Corpulence” , which aimed to completely avoid starch and sugar . 
25	Mr Banting lost 45 pounds , basing on a diet composed by lean meat , dry toast , soft boiled eggs and a few drinks a day . 
26	Thus , the Banting diet became a very well known method back then in the 19th century , promoted also for weight loss and diabetes control .

28	Retrieved 2010-08-26 More than a century after this , carbohydrate-restricted diets gained great popularity , particularly in the case of the Atkins Diet which emerged in 1972 , thanks to Dr Robert Atkins . 
29	While his diet is not a zero-carbohydrate diet , it does reduce carb intake to a ketogenic level in its initial stages ( 20&nbsp;grams daily in induction ; weekly increase of 5 thereafter ) , allowing followers to take advantage of the fat burning mechanism that is ketosis . 
30	According to him , this nutritional approach turns out to be more effective for weight loss than a low-fat , “high carbohydrate diet” , although there has always been much controversy and great dispute amongst healthcare professionals concerning drastic carbohydrate restriction . 
31	CBS Money Watch . 
32	Retrieved 2010-08-26 No-Carbohydrate diet is an extreme form of low-carbohydrate diets . 
33	The following is a list of foods that can be eaten due to their lack of carbohydrates : Meat : Followers of this diet can consume almost any kind of white and red meat . 
34	Seafood : All types of fish can be consumed : tuna , sole , trout , flounder , sardines and herring . 
35	Eggs : The best way to consume them is to boil them . 
36	Cheese : Cheddar , goat cheese , Gouda , Mozzarella , and Bleu cheese . 
37	Fat : Consumption is limited to natural and not hydrogenated animal fats , such as real unsalted butter , heavy cream , suet , lard and marrow . 
38	According to observational and prospectively designed studies from physicians and nutrition scientists , impaired physical performance is a common but not an obligate result of a low carbohydrate diet or no-carbohydrate diet . 
39	However , therapeutic use of ketogenic diets should not require restriction of any physical labor or recreational activity , with the particularity that only anaerobic performance is limited , such as weight lifting . 
40	In this case , due to the low glycogen levels in the ketogenic diet , competitive athletes cannot follow this kind of diet.In 
41	1939 two Danish scientists , Christensen and Hansen , made a study of low carbohydrate , moderate carbohydrate and high carbohydrate diets , each one lasting at least one week . 
42	At the end of each diet , the subjects ' endurance time to exhaustion on a stationery bicycle was measured , and they found that with the low carbohydrate they lasted only 81 minutes , while they were able to ride for 206 minutes after the high carbohydrates diet.In 
43	1946 , another experiment was made by Kark , Johnson and Lewis to determine effects of pemmican ( a mixture of fat and dry meat ) as an emergency ration for infantry troops in winter training in the Canadian Arctic . 
44	Results on this study showed that in 3 days , soldiers were unable to complete their assigned tasks . 
45	Then , in the 1960s , with the resurgence of biomedical science , new research revealed that fat had limited utility as fuel for high intensity exercise , and that humans are physically impaired if they are given a low carbohydrate or no-carbohydrate diet .

48	Retrieved 2010-08-26 At the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University , Philadelphia , researchers found recently that after a 2 year comparison , a low carbohydrate diet is almost similar to low-fat diet in terms of weight loss , but low-carbohydrate improves cardiovascular risk factors more , such as blood pressure and lipid levels . 
49	This study would suggest that low-carbohydrate diet protects individuals from potential coronary heart diseases in a more effective way . 
50	307 patients were randomly assigned to either one of the two diets and researchers found 2 years later that good cholesterol levels were higher among the low-carbohydrate group compared to the low-fat group , 23 % and 11 % respectively .

53	Anthony Rosenzweig , a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School , found that the increase in plaque build-up in the blood vessels and the impaired ability to form new vessels were associated with a reduction in vascular progenitor cells , which some researchers claim could play a protective role in keeping vascular health .

70	There are still serious doubts about the long term effects on health adopting a no-carbohydrate diet . 
71	In 2005 , the British Heart Foundation recommended not to follow these kind of diets , for those individuals who want to lose weight and take care of their heart . 
72	Working together with the Oxford University team , they found that the energy stored in the heart was reduced by an average of 16 % among those who followed a high-fat , low-carbohydrate diet .
