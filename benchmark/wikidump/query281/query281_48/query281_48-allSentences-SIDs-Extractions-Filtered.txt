Retrieved 2010-08-26 At the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University , Philadelphia , researchers found recently that after a 2 year comparison , a low carbohydrate diet is almost similar to low-fat diet in terms of weight loss , but low-carbohydrate improves cardiovascular risk factors more , such as blood pressure and lipid levels . 	48
