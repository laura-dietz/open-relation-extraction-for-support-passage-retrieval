3	It is important to know that dietary fat is needed for good health , as fats supply energy and fatty acids , in addition to supplying fat-soluble vitamins like A , D , E , and K. 
4	USDA , , Retrieved on July 2007 In recent years the exact health benefits of a low-fat diet have been debated . 
5	A 2006 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association argued that a low-fat diet did not reduce the incidence of breast cancer . 
6	However , this study was criticized by several epidemiologists for its lack of validity ( see " Criticisms " in the Women 's Health Initiative article ) . 
7	Recently , the Nurses ' Health Study from the Harvard School of Public Health reported from a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH) , and found that a diet " with high intake of fruits , vegetables , and whole grains , moderate intake of legumes , nuts , and low-fat dairy products , and low intake of red and processed meats and sodium , was significantly associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in women . 
8	" A 2002 Cochrane Review found low-fat diets to be no more effective than other weight loss diets in achieving lasting weight loss , two newer studies concluding the same , published 2008 .

11	There was a higher attrition rate in the low-fat compared with the low-carbohydrate groups suggesting a patient preference for a low-carbohydrate/high-protein approach as opposed to the Public Health preference of a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet . 
12	Evidence from this systematic review demonstrates that low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets are more effective at 6 months and are as effective , if not more , as low-fat diets in reducing weight and cardiovascular disease risk up to 1 year .
