0	Caloric restriction ( CR ) , or calorie restriction , is a dietary regimen that restricts calorie intake , where the baseline for the restriction varies , usually being the previous , unrestricted , intake of the subjects . 
1	Calorie restriction without malnutrition has been shown to improve age-related health and to slow the aging process in a wide range of animals and some fungi . 
2	CR is one of the few dietary interventions shown to increase both median and maximum lifespan in a variety of species , among them yeast , fish , rodents and dogs . 
3	There are ongoing studies on whether CR works in nonhuman primates , on its effects on human health , and on the metabolic parameters associated with CR in other species . 
4	The results so far are positive , but the studies are not yet complete , due to the long lifespan of the species . 
5	Among the current studies , one at UCSF , with Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn as part of the investigation team , is looking at long-term CR practitioners , including the psychological factors that keep them motivated to stay on a CR diet .

8	2011-09-02 Calorie restriction is a feature of several dietary regimens , including the Okinawa diet The Anti-Aging Plan : Strategies and Recipes for Extending Your Healthy Years by Roy Walford ( page 26 ) and the CRON-diet . 
9	In 1934 , Mary Crowell and Clive McCay of Cornell University observed that laboratory rats fed a severely reduced calorie diet while maintaining micronutrient levels resulted in life spans of up to twice as long as otherwise expected . 
10	These findings were explored in detail by a series of experiments with mice conducted by Roy Walford and his student Richard Weindruch . 
11	In 1986 , Weindruch reported that restricting the calorie intake of laboratory mice proportionally increased their life span compared to a group of mice with a normal diet . 
12	The calorie-restricted mice also maintained youthful appearances and activity levels longer and showed delays in age-related diseases . 
13	The results of the many experiments by Walford and Weindruch were summarized in their book The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction ( 1988 ) ( ISBN 0-398-05496-7 ) . 
14	The findings have since been accepted and generalized to a range of other animals . 
15	Researchers are investigating the possibility of parallel physiological links in humans . 
16	In the meantime , many people have independently adopted the practice of calorie restriction in some form . 
17	Some research has shown CR to reduce atherosclerosis risk factors .

22	17 A small study of long-term CR practitioners studied the effects of a diet with 10-25 % less calorie intake than the average " Western " diet . 
23	Mean Body mass index ( BMI ) was 19.6 
24	in the CR group ; the matched group BMI was 25.9 
25	, comparable to the BMI for middle-aged people in the US. 
26	Elisa Zied , , MSNBC , Oct 5 , 2007 The mean BMI in the CR group dropped from 24 ( range of 19.4 
27	to 29.6 
28	) to 19.5 
29	( range of 16.5 
30	to 22.8 
31	) over periods of 3–15 years . 
32	Nearly all the decrease in both BMI and cardiovascular risk factors occurred in the first year . 
33	Adjusting for age , the average total cholesterol and LDL ( bad ) cholesterol levels in the CR group were below those seen in all but the lowest 10 % of the population . 
34	The average HDL ( good ) cholesterol levels were in the 85th to 90th percentile range for normal middle-aged US men . 
35	The CR group had triglyceride levels as low as the lowest 5 % of Americans in their 20s . 
36	( The CR group age-range was 35-82 . 
37	) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in the CR group were about 100/60 , a level more typical of 10-year-olds July 2011 . 
38	Fasting plasma insulin concentration was 65 % lower . 
39	Fasting plasma glucose concentration was also lower . 
40	The principal investigator in this study noted an apparent lower rate of cardiovascular aging , with arteriosclerosis progress indicators particularly slowed . 
41	The comparison group 's statistics aligned approximately with the US national average on the dimensions considered .

120	Several studies revealed that dieters who restricted calories for 12 months had lower muscle mass and a reduced capacity to perform exercise compared with those who lost similar amounts of weight from exercise alone . 
121	Another study concluded that those who lost weight with the help of the CR diets are more prone to develop a loss of bone at the level of hip and spine , the area most at risk for bone fractures .

170	To date , there are no human studies that have demonstrated a positive or even neutral association between low body weight and longevity . 
171	In any case , epidemiological studies of body weight are not about CR as used in anti-aging studies ; they are not about calorie intake to begin with , as body weight is influenced by many factors other than energy intake . 
172	Moreover , " the quality of the diets consumed by the low-BM I individuals are difficult to assess , and may lack nutrients important to longevity . 
173	" Typical low-calorie diets rarely provide the high nutrient intakes that are a necessary feature of an anti-aging calorie restriction diet .

216	The effect of these diets on people who want to lose weight is controversial . 
217	November 2010 Although calorie restriction may provide quick weight loss , several studies have shown that the body adjusts to the new diet in about six months . 
218	September 2010 Researchers argue that people who have little body fat should not use this method of losing weight but rather should exercise more because calorie restriction in this case can be harmful .

221	Some try extreme calorie restriction for long life 2010-07-28 The reason for this is that after the body 's fat reserves have been burned for energy , the proteins within muscle tissue will be consumed . 
222	In severe cases where individuals do not acknowledge the dangers they are exposing themselves to , they may suffer serious loss of the muscle mass . 
223	Especially in children , adolescents and young adults ( under approximately 21 ) , calorie restriction is not advised because this type of diet may interfere with the natural physical growth , as it has been observed in laboratory animals . 
224	In addition , mental development and physical changes to the brain take place in late adolescence and early adulthood that could be negatively affected by calorie restriction .

259	Commenting on a study where CR showed generally positive effects , one researcher warned that " [i]t is possible that even moderate calorie restriction may be harmful in specific patient populations , such as lean persons who have minimal amounts of body fat .

266	A study on rhesus macaque , funded by the National Institute on Aging , was started in 1989 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and is still ongoing . 
267	This study has so far shown that caloric restriction in rhesus monkeys blunts aging and significantly delays the onset of age related disorders such as cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and brain atrophy . 
268	The monkeys were enrolled in the study at ages of between 7 and 14 years ; at the 20 year point 80 % of the calorically restricted monkeys were still alive , compared to only half of the controls . 
269	Science Daily , July 10 , 2009 These results bore out earlier preliminary results that showed lower fasting insulin and glucose levels as well as higher insulin sensitivity and LDL profiles associated with lower risk of atherogenesis in dietary restricted animals .

280	An additional analysis , restricted to causes of death related to aging , did find a significant reduction in age-related deaths . 
281	However , the interpretation of this finding is uncertain , as it is hypothetically possible exclusion of deaths due to non-aging causes may somehow mask an involvement of CR in such deaths , although the sample size is too low to say for certain .

303	For example , studies in female mice have shown that estrogen receptor -alpha declines in the aging pre-optic hypothalamus .

312	Fungi model are very easy to manipulate and many crucial steps toward the understanding of aging has been done with it . 
313	Many studies were published in budding yeast and fission yeast to analyse the cellular mechanisms behind the increased longevity due to calorie restriction . 
314	First , calorie restriction is often called dietary restriction because the same effects on life span can be reached by only changing the nutrient quality without changing the amount of calories . 
315	The data from Dr Guarente , Dr Kennedy , Dr Jazwinski , Dr Kaeberlein , Dr Longo , Dr Shadel , Dr Nyström , Dr Piper and others showed that genetic manipulations in nutrient signaling pathways could mimic the effects of dietary restriction . 
316	In some case dietary restriction needs mitochondrial respiration to increase longevity ( chronological aging ) and in some other case not ( replicative aging ) . 
317	Nutrient sensing in yeast controls stress defense , mitochondrial functions , Sir2 and others . 
318	These functions are all known to regulate aging . 
319	Genes involved in these mechanisms are : TOR , PKA , SCH9 , MSN2/4 , RIM15 , SIR2 ,..

357	Recent work in Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span by primarily increasing oxidative stress to exert an ultimately increased resistance against oxidative stress , a process called ( mito )hormesis .

370	Hormesis : A Revolution in Biology , Toxicology and Medicine By Mark P. 
371	Mattson , Edward J. 
372	Calabrese Hormesis Research has pointed toward hormesis as an explanation . 
373	Southam and Ehrlich ( 1943 ) reported that a bark extract that was known to inhibit fungal growth , actually stimulated growth when given at very low concentrations . 
374	They coined the term " hormesis " to describe such beneficial actions resulting from the response of an organism to a low-intensity biological stressor . 
375	The word "hormesis " is derived from the Greek word "hormaein " which means " to excite" . 
376	The ( Mito )hormesis hypothesis of CR proposes that the diet imposes a low-intensity biological stress on the organism , which elicits a defense response that helps protect it against the causes of aging . 
377	In other words , CR places the organism in a defensive state so that it can survive adversity , and this results in improved health and longer life . 
378	This switch to a defensive state may be controlled by longevity genes ( see below ) .

381	The mitochondrial hormesis was a purely hypothetical concept until late 2007 when work by Michael Ristow 's group in a small worm named Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span primarily by increasing oxidative stress to stimulate the organism into having an ultimately increased resistance to further oxidative stress .

386	This is probably the first experimental evidence for hormesis being the reason for extended life span following CR. 
387	Although aging can be conceptualized as the accumulation of damage , the more recent determination that free radicals participate in intracellular signaling has made the categorical equation of their effects with "damage " more problematic than was commonly appreciated in years past . 
388	It was previously proposed on a hypothetical basis that free radicals may induce an endogenous response culminating in more effective adaptations which protect against exogenous radicals ( and possibly other toxic compounds ) .

417	It has been recently argued that during years of famine , it may be evolutionarily desirable for an organism to avoid reproduction and to upregulate protective and repair enzyme mechanisms to try to ensure that it is fit for reproduction in future years . 
418	This seems to be supported by recent work studying hormones . 
419	[ Charlie Rose - Calorie restriction ] A study in male mice has found that CR generally feminizes gene expression and many of the most significantly changed individual genes are involved in aging , hormone signaling , and p53-associated regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis , it concluded that CR 's life-extension effects might arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of females .

471	?health 2007 ABC News 2007-05-03 Two very prominent proposed explanations of aging which have a bearing on calorie restriction are the free radical theory and the glycation theory . 
472	With high amounts of energy available , mitochondria do not operate very efficiently and generate more superoxide . 
473	With CR , energy is conserved and there is less free radical generation . 
474	A CR organism will have less fat and require less energy to support the weight , which also means that there does not need to be as much glucose in the bloodstream.Less 
475	blood glucose means less glycation of adjacent proteins and less fat to oxidize in the bloodstream to cause sticky blocks resulting in atherosclerosis . 
476	Type II Diabetics are people with insulin insensitivity caused by long-term exposure to high blood glucose . 
477	Obesity leads to type&nbsp;2 diabetes . 
478	Type&nbsp;2 diabetes and uncontrolled type&nbsp;1 diabetes are much like "accelerated aging" , due to the above effects . 
479	There may even be a continuum between CR and the metabolic syndrome . 
480	Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition has not been tested in comparison to Calorie Excess with Optimal Nutrition . 
481	It may be that with extra calories , nutrition must be similarly increased to ratios comparable to that of Calorie Restriction to provide similar antiaging benefits . 
482	Stated levels of calorie needs may be biased towards sedentary individuals . 
483	Calorie restriction may be no more than adapting the diet to the body 's needs . 
484	Work on the mechanisms of CR has given hope to the synthesising of future drugs to increase the human lifespan by simulating the effects of calorie restriction . 
485	However , MIT biologist Leonard Guarente cautioned that " (treatment ) wo n't be a substitute for a healthy lifestyle .

609	Gurarente has recently published that behavior associated with caloric restriction did not occur when Sirt1 knockout mice were put on a calorie restricted diet , the implication being that Sirt1 is necessary for mediating the effects of caloric restriction . 
610	However , the same paper also reported that the biochemical parameters thought to mediate the lifespan extending effects of calorie restriction ( reduced insulin , igf1 and fasting glucose ) , were no different in normal mice and mice lacking Sirt1 . 
611	Whether the lifespan-extending effect of CR was still evident in Sirt1 knockout mice was not reported in that study .

658	The authors hypothesize that the widely purported effects of CR may be because a diet containing more calories can increase bacteria proliferation , or that the type of high calorie diets used in past experiments have a stickiness , general composition , or texture that reduces longevity . 
659	Another related theory says that some of the calorie-restriction effects are artifacts , because the laboratory model organisms are kept at non-physiological high calorie diets . 
660	This would mean that calorie restriction simply means mimicking a natural environment energy supply . 
661	http ://upload.twidox.com/media/download/59328-pdf 
662	While some tests of calorie restriction have shown increased muscle tissue in the calorie-restricted test subjects , how this has occurred is unknown . 
663	June 2007 Muscle tissue grows when stimulated , so it is possible that the calorie-restricted test animals exercised more than their companions on higher calories . 
664	The reasons behind this may be that animals enter a foraging state during calorie restriction . 
665	In order to control this variable , such tests would need to be monitored to make sure that levels of physical activity are equal between groups . 
666	Exercise has also been shown to increase health and lifespan and lower the incidence of several diseases . 
667	Calorie restriction comes into conflict with the high calorie needs of athlete , and may not provide them adequate levels of energy or sufficient amino acids for repair , although this is not a criticism of CR per se , since it is certainly possible to be an unhealthy athlete , or an athlete destined to die at a young age due to poor diet , stresses , etc . 
668	Moreover , in experiments comparing CR to exercise , CR animals live much longer than exercised animals .

706	" They go on to conclude : " We conclude that ALS patients have a chronically deficient intake of energy and recommended augmentation of energy intake .

729	, chief of the National Institute on Aging 's ( NIA ) Laboratory of Neurosciences , and colleagues have found that intermittent fasting and calorie restriction affect the progression of diseases similar to Huntington 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , and Alzheimer 's disease in mice ( PMID 11119686 ) . 
730	In one study , rats and mice ate a low-calorie diet or were deprived of food for 24 hours every other day .

739	Both methods improved glucose metabolism , increased insulin sensitivity , and increased stress resistance . 
740	Researchers have long been aware that calorie restriction extends lifespan , but this study showed that improved glucose metabolism also protects neurons in experimental models of Parkinson 's and stroke . 
741	Another NIA study found that intermittent fasting and calorie restriction delays the onset of Huntington 's disease -like symptoms in mice and prolongs their lives .

746	Huntington 's disease ( HD) , a genetic disorder , results from neuronal degeneration in the striatum . 
747	This neurodegeneration results in difficulties with movements that include walking , speaking , eating , and swallowing . 
748	People with Huntington 's also exhibit an abnormal , diabetes-like metabolism that causes them to lose weight progressively . 
749	This NIA study compared adult HD mice who ate as much as they wanted with HD mice who were kept on an intermittent fasting diet during adulthood . 
750	HD mice possess the abnormal human gene huntingtin and exhibit clinical signs of the disease , including abnormal metabolism and neurodegeneration in the striatum . 
751	The mice on the fasting program developed clinical signs of the disease about 12 days later and lived 10 to 15 % longer than the free-fed mice . 
752	The brains of the fasting mice also showed less degeneration . 
753	Those on the fasting program also regulated their glucose levels better and did not lose weight as quickly as the other mice . 
754	Researchers found that fasting mice had higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) levels . 
755	BDNF protects neurons and stimulates their growth . 
756	Fasting mice also had high levels of heat-shock protein-70 ( Hsp70 ) , which increases cellular resistance to stress . 
757	Another NIA study compared intermittent fasting with cutting calorie intake . 
758	Researchers let a control group of mice eat freely (ad libitum ) . 
759	Another group was fed 60 % of the calories that the control group consumed . 
760	A third group was fasted for 24 hours , then permitted to free-feed . 
761	The fasting mice did n't cut total calories at the beginning and the end of the observation period , and only slightly cut calories in between . 
762	A fourth group was fed the average daily intake of the fasting mice every day . 
763	Both the fasting mice and those on a restricted diet had significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels than the free-fed controls . 
764	Kainic acid , a toxin that damages neuron , was injected into the dorsal hippocampus of all mice . 
765	Hippocampal damage is associated with Alzheimer 's . 
766	Interestingly , the scientists found less damage in the brains of the fasting mice than in those that ate a restricted diet , and most damage in mice with an unrestricted diet . 
767	But the control group which ate the average daily intake of the fasting mice also showed less damage than the mice with restricted diet .

778	in which overweight adult asthmatics followed alternate day calorie restriction ( ADCR ) for eight weeks showed marked improvement in oxidative stress , inflammation , and severity of the disease .
