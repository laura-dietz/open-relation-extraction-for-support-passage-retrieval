1	forketonuriaketone bodies in urine The ketogenic diet is a high-fat , adequate- protein , low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control ( refractory ) epilepsy in children . 
2	The diet mimics aspects of starvation by forcing the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrate . 
3	Normally , the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose , which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fuelling brain function . 
4	However , if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet , the liver converts fat into fatty acid and ketone bodies . 
5	The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source . 
6	An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood , a state known as ketosis , leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizure . 
7	The original therapeutic diet for pediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair , and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height . 
8	This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate . 
9	This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables , bread , pasta , grains and sugar , while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as cream and butter . 
10	Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LC Ts ) . 
11	However , medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs )—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chain than LC Ts—are more ketogenic . 
12	A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil , which is rich in MCTs , to provide around half the calories . 
13	As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet , a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed , allowing a greater variety of food choices . 
14	The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of pediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade , but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant drugs . 
15	In the mid 1990s , Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams , whose son 's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet , created the Charlie Foundation to promote it . 
16	Publicity included an appearance on NBC 's ''Dateline '' programme and ...First 
17	Do No Harm ( 1997 ) , a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep . 
18	The foundation sponsored a multicentre research study , the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet . 
19	The diet is effective in half of the patients who try it , and very effective in one third of patients . 
20	In 2008 , a randomised controlled trial showed a clear benefit for treating refractory epilepsy in children with the ketogenic diet . 
21	. 
22	There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet , and that a less strict regime , such as a modified Atkins diet , is similarly effective . 
23	Clinical trials and studies in animal models suggest that ketogenic diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying benefits for a number of adult neurodegenerative disorders . 
24	As of 2008 , research in this area is regarded as having provided insufficient positive data to warrant clinical use . 
25	Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders after stroke , and affects at least 50&nbsp;million people worldwide . 
26	It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizure . 
27	These occur when cortical neuron fire excessively , hypersynchronously , or both , leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function . 
28	This might affect , for example , the muscles , the senses , consciousness , or a combination . 
29	A seizure can be focal ( confined to one part of the brain ) or generalised ( spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness ) . 
30	Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons ; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndrome , most of which begin in childhood . 
31	Epilepsy is considered refractory to treatment when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it . 
32	About 60 % of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use , whereas about 30 % do not achieve control with drugs . 
33	When drugs fail , other options include epilepsy surgery , vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet . 
34	The ketogenic diet is a mainstream , nonpharmacologic therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy . 
35	Although popular in the 1920s and 30s , it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs . 
36	Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication . 
37	However , 20–30 % fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs . 
38	For this group , and for children in particular , the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management .

41	news report of Dr Hugh Conklin 's "water diet " treatment from 1922 Ancient Greek physicians treated diseases , including epilepsy , by altering their patients ' diet . 
42	An early treatise in the Hippocratic Corpus , On the Sacred Disease , mentions the disease ; it dates from 400 BC . 
43	Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure , and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis . 
44	In the same collection , the author of Epidemics describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared , through complete abstinence of food and drink . 
45	The royal physician Erasistratus declared , " One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations . 
46	" Galen believed an "attenuating diet " might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others . 
47	The first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911 . 
48	Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were "detoxified " by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet , combined with periods of fasting and purging . 
49	Two benefited enormously , but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions . 
50	The diet improved the patients ' mental capabilities , in contrast to their medication , potassium bromide , which dulled the mind . 
51	Around this time , Bernarr Macfadden , an American exponent of physical culture , popularised the use of fasting to restore health . 
52	His disciple , the osteopathic physician Hugh Conklin , of Battle Creek _ Michigan , began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting . 
53	Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin , secreted from the Peyer 's patches in the intestines , was discharged into the bloodstream . 
54	He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate . 
55	Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his "water diet " and boasted of a 90 % cure rate in children , falling to 50 % in adults . 
56	Later analysis of Conklin 's case records showed 20 % of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50 % had some improvement . 
57	Conklin 's fasting therapy was adopted by neurologists in mainstream practice . 
58	In 1916 , a Dr McMurray wrote to the New York Medical Journal claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast , followed by a starch - and sugar-free diet , since 1912 . 
59	In 1921 , prominent endocrinologist H. 
60	Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the American Medical Association convention . 
61	He had seen Conklin 's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients . 
62	He achieved similar results despite only having studied the patients for a short time . 
63	Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast . 
64	Charles Howland , the parent of one of Conklin 's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer , gave his brother John a gift of $ 5,000 to study " the ketosis of starvation " . 
65	As professor of paediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital , John Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist Stanley Cobb and his assistant William G. 
66	Lennox . 
67	In 1921 , Rollin Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and diabetes . 
68	He reported that three water-soluble compounds , β-hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate and acetone ( known collectively as ketone bodies ) , were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate , high-fat diet . 
69	Russel Wilder , at the Mayo Clinic , built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketones in the blood ( ketonemia ) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate . 
70	Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely . 
71	His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy . 
72	Wilder 's colleague , paediatrician Mynie Peterman , later formulated the classic diet , with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children , 10–15&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day , and the remainder of calories from fat . 
73	Peterman 's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet . 
74	Peterman documented positive effects ( improved alertness , behaviour , and sleep) and adverse effects ( nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis ) . 
75	The diet proved to be very successful in children : Peterman reported in 1925 that 95 % of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60 % became seizure-free . 
76	By 1930 , the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults . 
77	Clifford Barborka , also from the Mayo Clinic , reported that 56 % of those older patients improved on the diet and 12 % became seizure-free . 
78	Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children , they did not compare as well to contemporary studies . 
79	Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet , and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999 . 
80	During the 1920s and 1930s , when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative bromides ( discovered 1857 ) and phenobarbital ( 1912 ) , the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied . 
81	This changed in 1938 when H. 
82	Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin ( Dilantin ) , and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs . 
83	With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s , drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types . 
84	The use of the ketogenic diet , by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome , declined further . 
85	thumbalt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen_ a white opaque liquidMedium chain triglyceridesMedium-chain triglyceride(MCT) oil emulsion In the 1960s , it was discovered that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs ) produce more ketones per unit of energy than normal dietary fats ( which are mostly long-chain triglycerides ) . 
86	MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system . 
87	The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate . 
88	In 1971 , Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60 % of the calories came from the MCT oil , and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet . 
89	The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk , chilled , and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food . 
90	He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures . 
91	Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness , results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet . 
92	Gastrointestinal upset was a problem , which led one patient to abandon the diet , but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children . 
93	The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals , though some devised diets that were a combination of the two . 
94	The ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994 , when NBC 's ''Dateline '' television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams , son of Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams . 
95	The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies . 
96	Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to the Johns Hopkins Hospital , which had continued to offer the therapy . 
97	Under the diet , Charlie 's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed . 
98	This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research . 
99	A multicentre prospective study began in 1994 , the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published in 1998 . 
100	There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet . 
101	In 1997 , Abrahams produced a TV movie , ...First 
102	Do No Harm , starring Meryl Streep , in which a young boy 's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet . 
103	As of 2007 , the ketogenic diet is available from around 75 centres in 45 countries . 
104	Less restrictive variants , such as the modified Atkins diet , have come into use , particularly among older children and adults . 
105	The ketogenic diet is also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy . 
106	The ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50 % in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90 % in a third of patients . 
107	Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks , though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective . 
108	Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to find the ketogenic diet to be effective than to benefit from trying another anticonvulsant drug . 
109	There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet . 
110	Early studies reported high success rates : in one study in 1925 , 60 % of patients became seizure-free , and another 35 % of patients had a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency . 
111	These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician ( what is known as a retrospective study ) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions . 
112	However , these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials . 
113	One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias , as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results . 
114	In an attempt to control for this bias , modern study design prefers a prospective cohort ( the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins ) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment ( known as intent-to-treat analysis ) . 
115	Another difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time . 
116	When first developed and used , the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort ; in contrast , the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs , so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy . 
117	Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed . 
118	In older protocols , the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast , designed to lose 5–10 % body weight , and heavily restricted the calorie intake . 
119	Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet 's restrictions . 
120	Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet , but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones , and is no longer considered beneficial . 
121	The largest modern study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001 . 
122	As with most studies of the ketogenic diet , there was no control group ( patients who did not receive the treatment ) . 
123	The study enrolled 150 children . 
124	After three months , 83 % of them were still on the diet , 26 % had experienced a good reduction in seizures , 31 % had had an excellent reduction and 3 % were seizure-free . 
125	At twelve months , 55 % were still on the diet , 23 % had a good response , 20 % had an excellent response and 7 % were seizure-free . 
126	Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective , too restrictive or due to illness , and most of those who remained were benefiting from it . 
127	The percentage of those still on the diet at two , three and four years was 39 % , 20 % and 12 % respectively . 
128	During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better . 
129	At four years , 16 % of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency , 14 % had an excellent reduction and 13 % were seizure-free , though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet . 
130	Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an excellent response . 
131	It is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as meta-analysis . 
132	One of four such analyses , conducted in 2006 , looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients . 
133	It concluded that half the patients achieved a 50 % reduction in seizures and a third achieved a 90 % reduction . 
134	The first randomised controlled trial was published in 2008 , which had an intent-to-treat prospective design , but no blinding . 
135	This study enrolled 145 children , half of whom were randomly selected to start the ketogenic diet immediately and half to start after a three-month delay . 
136	The children who received delayed treatment acted as a control , which is particularly important for medical conditions such as epilepsy where patients may get better or worse regardless of treatment . 
137	Of the children in the diet group , 38 % had at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency , 7 % had at least a 90 % reduction , and one child became seizure-free . 
138	Only 6 % of the control group saw a greater than 50 % reduction in seizure frequency and no children had a 90 % reduction . 
139	The mean seizure frequency of the diet group fell by a third ; the control group 's mean seizure frequency actually got worse . 
140	thumbalt=AnticonvulsantsExperts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs ;most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number . 
141	The ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional ) treatment in children with drug-resistant epilepsy . 
142	It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland , England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies . 
143	Children with a focal lesion ( a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy ) who would make suitable candidates for surgery are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet . 
144	In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy . 
145	About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults . 
146	Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet —to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults . 
147	A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for , and well tolerated by , infants on formula and children who are tube-fed . 
148	Advocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed , as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10 % . 
149	The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness . 
150	These include Dravet syndrome , infantile spasms , myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex . 
151	A survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36 % regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed ; 24 % occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort ; 24 % had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases ; and 16 % had never prescribed the diet . 
152	There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice . 
153	One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitian , who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme . 
154	Because the ketogenic diet alters the body 's metabolism , it is a first-line therapy in children with certain congenital metabolic disease . 
155	However , it is absolutely contraindicated in others . 
156	The diseases pyruvate dehydrogenase ( E1 ) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel , which leads to a dependency on ketone bodies . 
157	The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication . 
158	In contrast , the diseases pyruvate carboxylase deficiency , porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism prevent any use of the diet . 
159	A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids , which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet . 
160	On the ketogenic diet , their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel , leading to acidosis , and eventually coma and death . 
161	The ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient 's existing anticonvulsant regime , though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful . 
162	There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide , and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital . 
163	The ketogenic diet is not a benign , holistic or natural treatment for epilepsy ; as with any serious medical therapy , there may be complications . 
164	These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery . 
165	Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation , low-grade acidosis , and hypoglycaemia if there is an initial fast . 
166	Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60 % of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30 % . 
167	This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet , such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats , and , if persistent , by lowering the ketogenic ratio . 
168	Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrient . 
169	Long-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of retarded growth , bone fractures , and kidney stone . 
170	The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 , which is important for childhood growth . 
171	Like many anticonvulsant drugs , the ketogenic has an adverse affect on bone health . 
172	Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone . 
173	About 1 in 20 children on the ketogenic diet will develop kidney stones ( compared with one in several thousand for the general population ) . 
174	A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ( topiramate , zonisamide ) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones , but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone . 
175	The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet . 
176	Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral potassium citrate supplements to all ketogenic diet patients , resulting in a sevenfold decrease in the incidence of kidney stones . 
177	However , this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial . 
178	Kidney stone formation ( nephrolithiasis ) is associated with the diet for four reasons : In adults , common side effects include weight loss , constipation , raised cholesterol levels and , in women , menstrual irregularities including amenorrhoea . 
179	The ketogenic diet is a medical nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines . 
180	Team members include a registered paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme ; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet ; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy . 
181	Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines . 
182	Lastly , the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented . 
183	Implementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals . 
184	Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required , some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant . 
185	Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet , like the Modified Atkins Diet or the Low Glycemic Index Treatment , because they find the difficulties too great . 
186	The Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted . 
187	It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and , later , a short hospital admission . 
188	Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation , most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in hospital . 
189	At the initial consultation , patients are screened for conditions that may contraindicate the diet . 
190	A dietary history is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected : the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate , the calorie requirements , and the fluid intake . 
191	The day before admission to hospital , the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal . 
192	On admission , only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids are allowed until dinner , which consists of " eggnog " restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal . 
193	The following breakfast and lunch are similar , and on the second day , the "eggnog " dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal 's caloric content . 
194	By the third day , dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal ( not "eggnog" ) . 
195	After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day , the patient is discharged . 
196	Where possible , the patient 's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations . 
197	When in the hospital , glucose levels are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic ketosis ( which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice ) . 
198	Lack of energy and lethargy are common but disappear within two weeks . 
199	The parents attend classes over the first three full days , which cover nutrition , managing the diet , preparing meals , avoiding sugar and handling illness . 
200	The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication . 
201	Variations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common . 
202	The initiation can be performed using outpatient clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital . 
203	Often there is no initial fast ( fasting increases the risk of acidosis and hypoglycaemia and weight loss ) . 
204	Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation , some institutions maintain meal size but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1. 
205	For patients who benefit , half achieve a seizure reduction within five days ( if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days ) , three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks , and 90 % achieve a reduction within 23 days . 
206	If the diet does not begin with a fast , the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer ( two weeks ) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected . 
207	Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy . 
208	After initiation , the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist , and various tests and examinations are performed . 
209	These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter . 
210	Infants under one year old are seen more frequently , with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks . 
211	A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient . 
212	This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories , altering the ketogenic ratio , or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet . 
213	Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet , though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect . 
214	This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside , which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate ( one of the three ketone bodies ) . 
215	A short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if ketone levels fluctuate . 
216	The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high , or the child is losing weight . 
217	Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources . 
218	Even " sugar-free " food can contain carbohydrates such as maltodextrin , sorbitol , starch and fructose . 
219	The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis . 
220	About 20 % of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures , and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether . 
221	Commonly , at around two years on the diet , or after six months of being seizure-free , the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months . 
222	This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected , and then lifting all calorie restrictions . 
223	This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children , where the child has become seizure free . 
224	When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases , the duration will be longer . 
225	The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents ; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial . 
226	Children who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20 % risk of seizures returning . 
227	The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years . 
228	This risk of recurrence compares with 10 % for resective surgery ( where part of the brain is removed ) and 30–50 % for anticonvulsant therapy . 
229	Of those that have a recurrence , just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet . 
230	Recurrence is more likely if , despite seizure freedom , an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) shows epileptiform spikes , which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure . 
231	Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities ( for example , as in children with tuberous sclerosis ) . 
232	Such children may remain on the diet longer than average , and it has been suggested that children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely . 
233	thumbalt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet _ the induction phase of the Atkins diet _ the classic ketogenic diet and the MCD ketogenic diet . 
234	The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates where the others have very little carbohydrate . 
235	The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others . 
236	Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.The 
237	ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets The ketogenic diet is calculated by a dietitian for each child . 
238	Age , weight , activity levels , culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan . 
239	First , the energy requirements are set at 80–90 % of the recommended daily amounts ( RDA ) for the child 's age ( the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet ) . 
240	Highly active children or those with muscle spasticity require more calories than this ; immobile children require less . 
241	The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein . 
242	This is typically 4:1 , but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months , older than 12&nbsp;years , or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio . 
243	Fat is energy-rich , with 9&nbsp;kcal/g ( 38&nbsp;kJ/g ) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g ( 17&nbsp;kJ/g ) for carbohydrate or protein , so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal . 
244	The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio . 
245	Next , the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance , and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight . 
246	Lastly , the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio . 
247	Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance . 
248	The total daily amount of fat , protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals . 
249	A computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes . 
250	The meals often have four components : heavy whipping cream , a protein-rich food (typically meat ) , a fruit or vegetable , and butter , vegetable oil or mayonnaise . 
251	Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed , which excludes bananas , potatoes , peas and corn . 
252	Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain , and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups . 
253	Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes . 
254	For example , cooked broccoli , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent . 
255	Fresh , canned or frozen foods are equivalent , but raw and cooked vegetables differ , and processed foods are an additional complication . 
256	Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1&nbsp;g . 
257	The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions ; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan . 
258	A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis . 
259	The ketogenic diet is not a balanced diet and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables , fortified cereals and calcium-rich foods . 
260	In particular , the B vitamins , calcium and vitamin D must be artificially supplemented . 
261	This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient 's age : a multivitamin with minerals , and calcium with vitamin D . 
262	A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio , 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises : Normal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglyceride (LC T) . 
263	Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised . 
264	Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate , leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes . 
265	The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60 % of its calories from MCT oil . 
266	Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps , diarrhoea and vomiting in some children . 
267	A figure of 45 % is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints . 
268	The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant . 
269	The MCT diet is less popular in the United States ; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies . 
270	First reported in 2003 , the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures . 
271	The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss , extending the induction phase indefinitely , and specifically encouraging fat consumption . 
272	Compared with the ketogenic diet , the modified Atkins diet ( MAD ) places no limit on calories or protein , and the lower overall ketogenic ratio ( approximately 1:1 ) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day . 
273	The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet . 
274	Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults , and are increased to 20–30&nbsp;g per day after a month or so , depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions . 
275	Like the ketogenic diet , the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics . 
276	The modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50 % in 43 % of patients who try it and by more than 90 % in 27 % of patients . 
277	Few adverse effects have been reported , though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term . 
278	Although based on a smaller data set ( 126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres ) , these results from 2009 compare favourably with the traditional ketogenic diet . 
279	The low glycemic index treatment ( LGIT ) is an attempt to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regime . 
280	The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet , which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content . 
281	Although it is also a high-fat diet ( with approximately 60 % calories from fat ) , the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet , approximately 40–60&nbsp;g per day . 
282	However , the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycemic index lower than 50 . 
283	Like the modified Atkins diet , the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support . 
284	Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes , and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents . 
285	Short-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50 % reduction in seizure frequency , with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet . 
286	The data ( coming from one centre 's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009 ) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated , with more palatable meals . 
287	thumbalt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale .Measuring 
288	KetoCal—a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet Infants and patients fed via a gastrostomy tube can also be given a ketogenic diet . 
289	Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula , such as KetoCal , into a liquid feed . 
290	Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability , and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula . 
291	Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet . 
292	KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids , fat , carbohydrate , vitamins , minerals and trace elements . 
293	It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year . 
294	The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios , either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding . 
295	Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia . 
296	Alternatively , a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose . 
297	There are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used , and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants . 
298	However , fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues . 
299	A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet . 
300	When families dine together , sharing the same meal , it can be difficult to separate the child 's meal . 
301	In many countries , food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat , protein and carbohydrate is difficult . 
302	In some countries , it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements , to purchase an accurate electronic scale , or to afford MCT oils . 
303	Jewish dietary laws prevent mixing meat and milk in one dish . 
304	In Asia , the normal diet includes rice and noodles as the main energy source , making their elimination difficult . 
305	Therefore the MCT-oil form of the diet , which allows more carbohydrate , has proved useful . 
306	In India , religious beliefs commonly affect the diet : some patients are vegetarians , or will not eat root vegetables , or avoid beef . 
307	The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children . 
308	The low-fat , high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio ( 1:1 ) than in America and Europe . 
309	However , they appear to be just as effective . 
310	In many developing countries , the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are dearer than grain , fruit and vegetables . 
311	The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries ; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful . 
312	The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian .

316	75 Skeletal formula of acetone acetone The brain is composed of a network of neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulse . 
317	The propagation of this impulse from one neuron 's synapse to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitter , though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons . 
318	Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing ( primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid , or GABA ) or they can excite the neuron into firing ( primarily done by glutamate ) . 
319	A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron , while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron . 
320	When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain , a seizure can occur . 
321	The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs , since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis , decreasing its breakdown , or enhancing its effect on neurons . 
322	The nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through channels in the neuron 's cell membrane followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels . 
323	The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time ( known as the refractory period ) , which is mediated by another potassium channel . 
324	The flow through these ion channel is governed by a "gate " which is opened by either a voltage change or a chemical messenger known as a ligand ( such as a neurotransmitter ) . 
325	These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs . 
326	There are many ways in which epilepsy occurs . 
327	Examples of pathological physiology include : unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain ; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow ; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis ; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters ; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess ; immature synapse development ; and impaired function of ionic channels . 
328	Although many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works , it remains a mystery . 
329	Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis ( high levels of acid in the blood ) , electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) . 
330	Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet , it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect . 
331	The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs . 
332	On the ketogenic diet , carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body . 
333	Instead , fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel . 
334	These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell 's mitochondria ( the energy-producing part of the cell ) . 
335	Humans can convert some amino acid into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis , but cannot do this for fatty acids . 
336	Since amino acids are needed to make proteins , which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues , these cannot be used only to produce glucose . 
337	This could pose a problem for the brain , since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose , and fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier . 
338	Fortunately , the liver can use fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate and acetone . 
339	These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose . 
340	The ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant in themselves ; in animal model , acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures . 
341	The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves ; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose , and the number of mitochondria is increased . 
342	This may help the neuron to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure , and may confer a neuroprotective effect . 
343	The ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures . 
344	It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant . 
345	Conversely , fenofibrate , not used clinically as an antiepileptic , exhibits experimental anticonvulsant properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet . 
346	19054409 19054409 This , together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs , suggests a unique mechanism of action . 
347	Anticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures , but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility . 
348	The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis ) is a process that is poorly understood . 
349	A few anticonvulsants ( valproate , levetiracetam and benzodiazepine ) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis . 
350	However , no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans . 
351	The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats . 
352	The ketogenic diet may be a successful treatment for several rare metabolic diseases . 
353	Case reports of two children indicate that it may be a possible treatment for astrocytoma , a type of brain tumour . 
354	Autism , depression , migraine headaches , polycystic ovary syndrome , and type 2 diabetes mellitus have also been shown to improve in small case studies . 
355	There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease , and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke . 
356	Because tumour cells are inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy , the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer . 
357	2008 , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for these conditions ; however , clinical trials for many of them are ongoing . 
358	In March 2009 , caprylidene ( Axona ) was approved as a medical food by the US Food and Drug Administration for the "dietarymanagement of the metabolic processes and nutritional requirements associated with mild to moderate Alzheimer 's disease " . 
359	Glucose metabolism by the brain is impaired in Alzheimer 's disease , and it is proposed that ketone bodies may provide an alternative energy source .

1078	Bones are mainly composed of calcium phosphate . 
1079	The phosphate reacts with the acid , and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys . 
1080	Hypocitraturia : the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate , which normally helps to dissolve free calcium . 
1081	The urine has a low pH , which stops uric acid from dissolving , leading to crystals that act as a nidus for calcium stone formation . 
1082	Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80 % of normal daily needs ; this practice is no longer encouraged .
