; Eades , Mary Dan : Protein Power , Chapter 1 , Bantam Books , 1999 , ISBN 0553380788 The key scientific principle which forms the basis for these diets is the relationship between consumption of carbohydrates and the subsequent effect on blood sugar ( i .e 	226
. 	227
blood glucose ) and on production of certain specific hormone . 	228
Blood sugar levels in the human body must be maintained in a fairly narrow range to maintain health . 	229

The two primary hormones related to regulating blood sugar levels , produced in the pancreas , are insulin , which lowers blood sugar levels (among many other effects , most of considerable metabolic significance ) , and glucagon , which raises blood sugar levels . 	230

Another aspect of insulin secretion is control of ketosis ; in the non-ketotic state , the human body stores dietary fat in fat cells ( i .e 	233
. 	234
, adipose tissue ) and preferentially uses glucose as cellular fuel . 	235
By contrast , low-carbohydrate diets , or more properly , diets that are very low in nutritive carbohydrates , evoke less insulin ( to cover the ingested glucose in the blood stream ) , leading to longer and more frequent episodes of ketosis . 	236

Some researchers suggest that this causes body fat to be eliminated from the body , although this theory remains controversial , insofar as it refers to excretion of lipids ( i .e 	237
. 	238
, fat and oil ) and not to fat metabolism during ketosis . 	239

"The differences"	"are"	"due"	285
However , as foods influence digestion in complex ways ( e .g. 	286
, both protein and fat delay absorption of glucose from carbohydrates eaten at the same time ) it is difficult to even approximate the glycemic effect ( e .g. 	287
, over time or even in total in some cases ) of a particular meal . 	288
Another related diet type , the low-insulin-index diet , is similar except that it is based on measurements of direct insulemic responses ( i .e 	289
. 	290
, the amount of insulin in the bloodstream ) to food rather than glycemic response ( the amount of glucose in the bloodstream ) . 	291
Although such diet recommendations mostly involve lowering nutritive carbohydrates , there are some low-carbohydrate foods that are discouraged as well ( e .g. 	292
, beef ) . 	293
