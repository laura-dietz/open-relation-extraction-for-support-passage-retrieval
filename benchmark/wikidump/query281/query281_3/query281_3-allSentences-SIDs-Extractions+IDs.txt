Another aspect of insulin secretion is control of ketosis ; in the non-ketotic state , the human body stores dietary fat in fat cells ( i .e 	233	query281_Low-carbohydrate_diet\S\233

However , as foods influence digestion in complex ways ( e .g. 	286	query281_Low-carbohydrate_diet\S\286
, both protein and fat delay absorption of glucose from carbohydrates eaten at the same time ) it is difficult to even approximate the glycemic effect ( e .g. 	287	query281_Low-carbohydrate_diet\S\287
, over time or even in total in some cases ) of a particular meal . 	288	query281_Low-carbohydrate_diet\S\288
Another related diet type , the low-insulin-index diet , is similar except that it is based on measurements of direct insulemic responses ( i .e 	289	query281_Low-carbohydrate_diet\S\289

, the amount of insulin in the bloodstream ) to food rather than glycemic response ( the amount of glucose in the bloodstream ) . 	291	query281_Low-carbohydrate_diet\S\291
