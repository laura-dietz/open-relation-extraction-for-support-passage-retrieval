0	Low-carbohydrate diets or low-carb diets are dietary programs that restrict carbohydrate consumption usually for weight control or for the treatment of obesity . 
1	Foods high in digestible carbohydrates ( e .g 
2	. 
3	bread , pasta ) are limited or replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of proteins and fat ( e .g 
4	. 
5	meat , poultry , fish , shellfish , eggs , cheese , nuts , seeds and peanuts ) and other foods low in carbohydrates ( e .g 
6	. 
7	most salad vegetable ) , although other vegetable and fruit (especially berries ) are often allowed . 
8	The amount of carbohydrate allowed varies with different low-carbohydrate diets . 
9	Such diets are sometimes ketogenic ( i .e 
10	. 
11	they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause ketosis ) , such as the Induction phase of the Atkins diet .

40	Paleolithic# Diet and nutrition Paleolithic : Diet and nutrition As with the Paleolithic diet , several advocates of low-carbohydrate diets have argued that they are closer to the ancestral diet of humans before the invention of agriculture , and therefore that humans are genetically adapted to diets low in carbohydrate . 
41	November 2011 Direct archaeological or fossil evidence on nutrition during the Paleolithic era , when all humans subsisted by hunting and gathering , is limited , but suggests that humans evolved from the vegetarian diets common to other great apes to one with a greater level of meat eating .

51	A more detailed picture of early human diets before the invention of agriculture may be obtained by analogy to contemporary hunter-gatherers . 
52	According to one survey of these societies , a relatively low carbohydrate ( 22–40 % of total energy ) , animal food-centered diet is preferred "whenever and wherever it [is ] ecologically possible" , and where plant foods do predominate carbohydrate consumption remains low because wild plants are much lower in carbohydrate and higher in fiber than modern domesticated crops . 
53	10702160 10702160 Primatologist Katherine Milton , however , has argued that the survey data this conclusion is based on inflates the animal content of typical hunter-gatherer diets ; much of it was based on early ethnography which may have overlooked the role of women in gathering plant foods . 
54	10702155 10702155 She has also highlighted the diversity of both ancestral and contemporary foraging diets , arguing that there is no evidence that humans are especially adapted to a single Paleolithic diet over and above the vegetarian diets characteristic of the last thirty million years of primate evolution .

119	December 2011 December 2011 The book met with some success but , because of research at that time suggesting risk factors associated with excess fat and protein , it was widely criticized by the mainstream medical community as being dangerous and misleading , thereby limiting its appeal at the time .

121	Atkins had done little real research into his theories and based them mostly on anecdotal evidence .

127	David Jenkins to account for variances in speed of digestion of carbohydrates ( e .g. 
128	, the sugar in cooked carrots has more rapid effect than pure glucose ) .

220	Atkins ( in the later phases ) and some other low-carbohydrate diets exceed the 60g limit definition by this group . 
221	There is no widely accepted definition of what precisely constitutes a low-carbohydrate diet . 
222	It is important to note that the level of carbohydrate consumption defined as low-carbohydrate by medical researchers may be different from the level of carbohydrate defined by diet advisors . 
223	For the purposes of this discussion , this article focuses on diets that reduce ( nutritive ) carbohydrate intake sufficiently to dramatically reduce insulin production in the body and to encourage ketosis ( production of ketones to be used as energy in place of glucose ) . 
224	Although originally low-carbohydrate diets were created based on anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness , today there is a much greater theoretical basis on which these diets rest . 
225	Ann Louise Gittleman : , Chapter 5 , McGraw Hill , 11 March 1999 , ISBN 087983966X / 9780879839666 Eades , Michael R. 
226	; Eades , Mary Dan : Protein Power , Chapter 1 , Bantam Books , 1999 , ISBN 0553380788 The key scientific principle which forms the basis for these diets is the relationship between consumption of carbohydrates and the subsequent effect on blood sugar ( i .e 
227	. 
228	blood glucose ) and on production of certain specific hormone . 
229	Blood sugar levels in the human body must be maintained in a fairly narrow range to maintain health . 
230	The two primary hormones related to regulating blood sugar levels , produced in the pancreas , are insulin , which lowers blood sugar levels (among many other effects , most of considerable metabolic significance ) , and glucagon , which raises blood sugar levels . 
231	, EndocrineWeb.com 
232	, retrieved 12 March 2008 In general , most western diets ( and many others ) are sufficiently high in nutritive carbohydrates that nearly all meals evoke insulin secretion from the beta cells in the pancreas ; carbohydrates which are digested to produce glucose in the blood stream are the primary control for insulin secretion . 
233	Another aspect of insulin secretion is control of ketosis ; in the non-ketotic state , the human body stores dietary fat in fat cells ( i .e 
234	. 
235	, adipose tissue ) and preferentially uses glucose as cellular fuel . 
236	By contrast , low-carbohydrate diets , or more properly , diets that are very low in nutritive carbohydrates , evoke less insulin ( to cover the ingested glucose in the blood stream ) , leading to longer and more frequent episodes of ketosis . 
237	Some researchers suggest that this causes body fat to be eliminated from the body , although this theory remains controversial , insofar as it refers to excretion of lipids ( i .e 
238	. 
239	, fat and oil ) and not to fat metabolism during ketosis . 
240	December 2011 December 2011 Low-carbohydrate diet advocates in general recommend reducing nutritive carbohydrates ( commonly referred to as " net carbs , " i .e

262	Generally they all agree that processed sugar should be eliminated , or at the very least greatly reduced , and similarly generally discourage heavily processed grains ( white bread , etc. 
263	) . 
264	Low-carbohydrate diets vary greatly in their recommendations as to the amount of fat allowed in the diet . 
265	The Atkins Diet does not limit fat . 
266	Others recommend a moderate fat intake . 
267	Although low-carbohydrate diets are most commonly discussed as a weight-loss approach , some experts have proposed using low-carbohydrate diets to mitigate or prevent diseases including diabetes , metabolic disease and epilepsy .

281	New York , NY In reality , low-carbohydrate diets can also be low-GL diets ( and vice versa ) depending on the carbohydrates in a particular diet . 
282	In practice , though , "low-GI" /"low-GL " diets differ from "low-carb " diets in the following ways . 
283	First , low-carbohydrate diets treat all nutritive carbohydrates as having the same effect on metabolism , and generally assume that their effect is predictable . 
284	Low- GI/low-GL diets are based on the measured change in blood glucose levels in various carbohydrates - these vary markedly in laboratory studies . 
285	The differences are due to poorly understood digestive differences between foods . 
286	However , as foods influence digestion in complex ways ( e .g. 
287	, both protein and fat delay absorption of glucose from carbohydrates eaten at the same time ) it is difficult to even approximate the glycemic effect ( e .g. 
288	, over time or even in total in some cases ) of a particular meal . 
289	Another related diet type , the low-insulin-index diet , is similar except that it is based on measurements of direct insulemic responses ( i .e 
290	. 
291	, the amount of insulin in the bloodstream ) to food rather than glycemic response ( the amount of glucose in the bloodstream ) . 
292	Although such diet recommendations mostly involve lowering nutritive carbohydrates , there are some low-carbohydrate foods that are discouraged as well ( e .g. 
293	, beef ) .

298	1264–1276 9356547 5 Insulin secretion is stimulated ( though less strongly ) by other dietary intake . 
299	Like glycemic index diets , there is difficulty predicting the insulin secretion from any particular meal , due to assorted digestive interactions and so differing effects on insulin release . 
300	At the heart of the debate about most low carbohydrate diets are fundamental questions about what is a normal diet and how the human body is supposed to operate . 
301	These questions can be outlined as follows : The diets of most people in modern western nations , especially the United States , contain large amounts of starches and often substantial amounts of sugars , including fructose . 
302	Most westerners seldom exhaust stored glycogen supplies and hence rarely go into ketosis . 
303	This has been regarded by medical science in the last century as normal for humans . 
304	August 2010 Ketosis had widely been regarded as harmful and potentially life-threatening , unnecessarily stressing the liver and causing destruction of muscle tissues , August 2010 and ketosis had sometimes been confused with ketoacidosis , a dangerous and extreme ketotic condition associated with diabetes . 
305	A perception developed that getting energy chiefly from dietary protein rather than carbohydrates causes liver damage and that getting energy chiefly from dietary fats rather than carbohydrates causes heart disease and other health problems . 
306	This view is still held by the majority of those in the medical and nutritional science communities .

315	People who eschew low carbohydrate diets cite hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis as a risk factor , but these are only problematic for people such as diabetics , who have impaired regulation of gluconeogenesis and ketone metabolism .

317	Low blood glucose causes the pancreas to produce glucagon , Carr , Timothy P. 
318	: , Chapter 7 , Blackwell Publishing , October 2002 , ISBN 9780632045648 which stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the blood . 
319	When liver glycogen stores are exhausted , the body starts utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose . 
320	The brain cannot use fatty acids for energy , and instead uses ketones produced from fatty acids by the liver . 
321	By using fatty acids and ketones as energy sources , supplemented by conversion of proteins to glucose ( gluconeogenesis ) , the body can maintain normal levels of blood glucose without dietary carbohydrates . 
322	Most advocates of low-carbohydrate diets , such as the Atkins Diet , argue that the human body is adapted to function primarily in ketosis .

335	Just What is Optimal ? D-Solve : Low Carb &amp; Low Insulin Diabetes Management February 2005 They argue that high insulin levels can cause many health problems , most significantly fat storage and weight gain . 
336	They argue that the purported dangers of ketosis are unsubstantiated ( some of the arguments against ketosis result from confusion between ketosis and ketoacidosis which is a mostly diabetic condition unrelated to dieting or low-carbohydrate intake ) . 
337	Dolson , Laura : , About.com 
338	: Low Carb Diets , retrieved 13 March 2008 They also argue that fat in the diet only contributes to heart disease in the presence of high insulin levels and that if the diet is instead adjusted to induce ketosis , fat and cholesterol in the diet are not a major concern ( although most do not advocate unrestricted fat intake and do advocate avoiding trans fat ) . 
339	On a high-carbohydrate diet , glucose is used by cells in the body for the energy needed for their basic functions , and about 2/3 of body cells require insulin in order to use glucose . 
340	Excessive amounts of blood glucose are thought to be a primary cause of the complications of diabetes ; when glucose reacts with body proteins ( resulting in glycosolated proteins ) and change their behavior . 
341	Perhaps for this reason , the amount of glucose tightly maintained in the blood is quite low . 
342	Unless a meal is very low in starches and sugars , blood glucose will rise for a period of an hour or two after a meal . 
343	When this occurs , beta cells in the pancreas release insulin to cause uptake of glucose into cells . 
344	In liver and muscle cells , more glucose is taken in than is needed and stored as glycogen (once called 'animal starch' ) . 
345	Bowen , R. 
346	: , Colorado State University : Hypertexts for Biomedical Sciences , 8 December 2002 Diets with a high starch/sugar content , therefore , cause release of more insulin and so more cell absorption . 
347	In diabetics , glucose levels vary in time with meals and vary a little more as a result of high carbohydrate content meals . 
348	In non-diabetics , blood sugar levels are restored to normal levels within an hour or two , regardless of the content of a meal . 
349	While there are Essential fatty acids ( EFA ) and Essential amino acids ( EAA ) and while a diet devoid of EFA or EAA will result in eventual death , a diet completely without carbohydrates can be maintained indefinitely because fatty acids include a carbohydrate backbone ( Glycerol ) . 
350	Long-term consumption of a carbohydrate-restricted diet does not induce deleterious metabolic effects There are essential fatty acids and amino acids for structural building blocks , not energy . 
351	EPA and EAA will be converted into intermediates for the carbohydrate metabolism , even if it depletes their essential stocks . 
352	However , a very low carbohydrate diet ( less than 20g per day ) may negatively affect certain biomarkers Arizona State University ( 2007 , December 17 ) .

594	There is a large body of evidence stretching back to the 1880s that shows that physical performance is not negatively affected by ketogenic diets once a person has been acclimatized to such a diet . 
595	March 2011 Arctic cultures such as the Inuit and African cultures such as the Maasai Tribesmen lead physically demanding lives and yet consume a diet almost completely devoid of carbohydrates . 
596	March 2011 However , studies also indicate that while a low carbohydrate diet will not reduce endurance performance after adapting , they will probably deteriorate anaerobic performance such as strength training or sprint running because these processes rely on glycogen for fuel . 
597	A living example that a ketogenic diet can indeed be combined with outstanding achievements in physical exercise is the Olympic biathlon gold medalist Björn Ferry , who won his gold medal after about 6 months on a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet .

626	Vegan/Vegetarian Diets Can be Low Carb Updated August 28 , 2007 Dolson Laura http ://lowcarbdiets .about.com/od/vegetarian/a/veganlowcarb.htm 
627	Meet a Vegan Low Carber ! 
628	Vegan/Vegetarian Diets Can be Low Carb Updated August 28 , 2007 Raw fruits and vegetables are packed with array of other protective chemicals like vitamins , flavonoids or sugar alcohols . 
629	Some of those molecules can inhibit sugar absorption from intestines and provide other benefits in sugar control . 
630	Inhibition of the intestinal glucose transporter GLUT2by ﬂavonoids Flavonoid inhibition of SVCT1 and GLUT2 , intestinal transporters for vitamin C and glucose Industrial food raffination depletes some of those beneficial molecules in various degrees , including almost total removal in many cases . 
631	Impact of Alkalization on the Antioxidant and Flavanol Content of Commercial Cocoa Powders CHANGES IN FATTY ACID PROFILES AND OMEGA FATTY ACIDCONTENTS OF SELECTED VEGETABLE OILS DURING REFININGPROCESS The major low-carbohydrate diet guides generally recommend multi-vitamin and mineral supplements as part of the diet regimen which may lead some to believe that these diets are nutritionally deficient . 
632	The primary reason for this recommendation is that if the switch from a high-carbohydrate to a low-carbohydrate , ketogenic diet is rapid , the body can temporarily go through a period of adjustment during which the body may require extra vitamins and minerals ( the reasons have to do with the body 's releasing excess fluids that were stored during high-carbohydrate eating ) . 
633	In other words , the body goes through a temporary " shock " if the diet is changed to low-carbohydrate dieting quickly just as it would changing to a high-carbohydrate diet quickly . 
634	This does not , in and of itself , indicate that either type of diet is nutritionally deficient . 
635	While it is true that many foods that are rich in carbohydrates are also rich in vitamins and minerals , there are many low-carbohydrate foods that are similarly rich in vitamins and minerals . 
636	Cordain , Loren : , pages 106-107 , Wiley , 2002 , 272 pages , ISBN 0471413909 A common argument in favor of high-carbohydrate diets is that most carbohydrates break down readily into glucose in the bloodstream and , therefore , the body does not have to work as hard to get its energy in a high-carbohydrate diet as a low-carbohydrate diet . 
637	This argument , by itself , is incomplete . 
638	Although many dietary carbohydrates do break down into glucose , most of that glucose does not remain in the bloodstream for long . 
639	Its presence stimulates the beta cells in the pancreas to release insulin which has the effect of causing about 2/3 of body cells to take in glucose , and to cause fat cells to take in fatty acids and store them . 
640	As the blood glucose level falls , the amount of insulin released is reduced ; the entire process is completed in non-diabetics in an hour or two after eating . 
641	Craig Freudenrich , Ph.D. 
642	: , , retrieved 25 July 2008 High - carbohydrate diets require more insulin production and release than low-carbohydrate diets and there is some evidence that the increasingly large percentage of calories consumed as carbohydrates has led to the increased incidence of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes .

647	?view=long&pmid=15113714 In addition , this claim neglects the nature of the carbohydrates ingested . 
648	Some are indigestible in humans ( e .g. 
649	, cellulose ) , some are poorly digested in humans ( e .g. 
650	, the amylose starch variant ) , and some require considerable processing to be converted to absorbable forms . 
651	In general , uncooked or unprocessed ( e .g. 
652	, milling , crushing , etc. 
653	) foods are harder (typically much harder ) to absorb and so do not raise glucose levels as much as might be expected from the proportion of carbohydrate present . 
654	Cooking (especially moist cooking above the temperature necessary to expand starch granules ) , and mechanical processing , both considerably raise the amount of absorbable carbohydrate and reduce the digestive effort required . 
655	Analyses which neglect these factors are misleading and will not result in a working diet , or at least one which works as intended . 
656	( See Catching Fire , Richard Wrangham ) In fact , there is some evidence that the human brain – the largest consumer of glucose in the body – can operate more efficiently on ketones .

659	In 2004 , the Canadian government ruled that foods sold in Canada could not be marketed with reduced or eliminated carbohydrate content as a selling point because reduced carbohydrate content was not determined to be a health benefit , and that existing "low carb " and " no carb " packaging would have to be phased out by 2006 . 
660	January 2011 Some variants of low carbohydrate diets involve substantially lowered intake of dietary fiber which can result in constipation if not supplemented . 
661	What is the scientific evidence for this assertion ? January 2011 For example , this has been a criticism of the Induction phase of the Atkins diet ( the Atkins diet is now clearer about recommending a fiber supplement during Induction ) . 
662	Most advocates today argue that fiber is a "good " carbohydrate and encourage a high-fiber diet . 
663	It has been hypothesized that a diet-related change in blood acidity can lead to bone loss through a process called ketoacidosis , as mentioned earlier in this article . 
664	However ketoacidosis , which is often confused with ketosis , is an acute medical condition caused by extreme fasting or as a symptom of untreated diabetes , and is not likely to be induced by an otherwise adequate low-carbohydrate diet . 
665	One of the occasional side effects of a ketogenic diet is a noticeable smell of ketones in the urine , perspiration , and breath .
