233	Another aspect of insulin secretion is control of ketosis ; in the non-ketotic state , the human body stores dietary fat in fat cells ( i .e 
234	. 
235	, adipose tissue ) and preferentially uses glucose as cellular fuel . 
236	By contrast , low-carbohydrate diets , or more properly , diets that are very low in nutritive carbohydrates , evoke less insulin ( to cover the ingested glucose in the blood stream ) , leading to longer and more frequent episodes of ketosis .

237	Some researchers suggest that this causes body fat to be eliminated from the body , although this theory remains controversial , insofar as it refers to excretion of lipids ( i .e 
238	. 
239	, fat and oil ) and not to fat metabolism during ketosis .

285	"285 The differences"	"are due"	"to poorly understood digestive differences between foods"	
285	"285 The differences"	"are"	"due"	
286	However , as foods influence digestion in complex ways ( e .g. 
287	, both protein and fat delay absorption of glucose from carbohydrates eaten at the same time ) it is difficult to even approximate the glycemic effect ( e .g. 
288	, over time or even in total in some cases ) of a particular meal . 
289	Another related diet type , the low-insulin-index diet , is similar except that it is based on measurements of direct insulemic responses ( i .e 
290	. 
291	, the amount of insulin in the bloodstream ) to food rather than glycemic response ( the amount of glucose in the bloodstream ) . 
292	Although such diet recommendations mostly involve lowering nutritive carbohydrates , there are some low-carbohydrate foods that are discouraged as well ( e .g. 
293	, beef ) .
