5	© 2007 It is almost always generalized throughout the body , with hyperketonemia , that is , an elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood . 
6	Ketone bodies are formed by ketogenesis when the liver glycogen stores are depleted . 
7	The ketone bodies acetoacetate and β - hydroxybutyrate are used for energy . 
8	Harvey &amp; Champe , biochemistry Often ketosis can be detected by a "nail polish remover " smell of the breath . 
9	citing : When glycogen stores are not available in the cells , fat ( triacylglycerol ) is cleaved to give 3 fatty acid chains and 1 glycerol molecule in a process called lipolysis . 
10	Most of the body is able to use fatty acids as an alternative source of energy in a process called beta-oxidation . 
11	One of the products of beta-oxidation is acetyl-CoA , which can be further used in the Krebs cycle . 
12	During prolonged fasting or starvation , acetyl- CoA in the liver is used to produce ketone bodies instead , leading to a state of ketosis . 
13	During starvation or a long physical training session , the body starts using fatty acids instead of glucose . 
14	The brain cannot use long-chain fatty acids for energy because they are completely albumin -bound and cannot cross the blood-brain barrier . 
15	Not all medium-chain fatty acids are bound to albumin . 
16	The unbound medium-chain fatty acids are soluble in the blood and can cross the blood-brain barrier . 
17	The ketone bodies produced in the liver can also cross the blood-brain barrier . 
18	In the brain , these ketone bodies are then incorporated into acetyl- CoA and used in the citric acid cycle . 
19	The ketone body acetoacetate will slowly decarboxylate into acetone , a volatile compound that is both metabolized as an energy source and lost in the breath and urine . 
20	Ketoacidosis Ketone bodies are acidic , but acid-base homeostasis in the blood is normally maintained through bicarbonate buffering , respiratory compensation to vary the amount of CO 2 in the bloodstream , hydrogen ion absorption by tissue proteins and bone , and renal compensation through increased excretion of dihydrogen phosphate and ammonium ions .

26	. 
27	There are two major causes of ketoacidosis : A mild acidosis may result from prolonged fasting or when following a ketogenic diet .

30	If the diet is changed from a highly glycemic diet to a diet that does not provide sufficient carbohydrate to replenish glycogen stores , the body goes through a set of stages to enter ketosis . 
31	During the initial stages of this process , blood glucose levels are maintained through gluconeogenesis , and the adult brain does not burn ketones ; however , the brain makes immediate use of ketones for lipid synthesis in the brain . 
32	After about 48 hours of this process , the brain starts burning ketones in order to more directly use the energy from the fat stores that are being depended upon , and to reserve the glucose only for its absolute needs , thus avoiding the depletion of the body 's protein store in the muscles .

39	Ketosis is deliberately induced by use of a ketogenic diet as a medical intervention in cases of intractable epilepsy . 
40	Other uses of low-carbohydrate diet remain controversial .

63	?view=long&pmid=12684364 Whether ketosis is taking place can be checked by using special urine test strips such as Ketostix . 
64	The strips have a small pad on the end which is dipped in a fresh specimen of urine . 
65	Within a matter of seconds , the strip changes color indicating the level of ketone bodies detected , which reflects the degree of ketonuria , which , in turn , can be used to give a rough estimation of the level of hyperketonemia in the body ( see table below ) . 
66	Normal serum reference ranges for ketone bodies are 0.5-3.0&nbsp;mg/dL 
67	, equivalent to 0.05-0.29&nbsp;mmol/L 
68	. 
69	Also , when the body is in ketosis , subjects often smell of acetone . 
70	Some find the smell offensive as acetone is the same chemical responsible for the smell in paint thinner and nail polish remover . 
71	Some clinicians regard ketosis as a dangerous and potentially life-threatening state that stresses the liver .

76	Ketosis , which is accompanied by gluconeogenesis ( the creation of glucose de novo from pyruvate ) , is the specific state with which clinicians are concerned . 
77	The anti-ketosis conclusions have been challenged by a number of doctors and advocates of low-carbohydrate diet , who dispute assertions that the body has a preference for glucose and that there are dangers associated with ketosis .

94	34 It has been argued that the Inuit lived for thousands of years on a diet that would have been ketogenic , and there are many documented cases of modern humans living in these societies for extended periods of time . 
95	On the other hand , it is speculated by Nick Lane Lane Nick 254–256 Power Sex Suicide Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life 2005 0192804812 Lane Nick 254–256 Power Sex Suicide Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life 2005 0192804812 that the Inuit may have a genetic predisposition allowing them to healthfully eat a ketogenic diet . 
96	According to this view , such an evolutionary adaptation would have been caused by environmental stresses .

116	Alcoholic ketoacidosis ( AKA ) presents infrequently , but can occur with acute alcohol intoxication , most often following a binge in alcoholics with acute or chronic liver or pancreatic disorders . 
117	Alcoholic ketoacidosis occurs more frequently following methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication than following intoxication with uncontaminated ethanol .
