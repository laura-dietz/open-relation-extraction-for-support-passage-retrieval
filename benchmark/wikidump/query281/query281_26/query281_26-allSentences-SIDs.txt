1	Although the usual intention is weight loss and change in body type , sometimes the intention is to aid in gaining weight or muscle as in bodybuilding supplements . 
2	In addition to diet other words or phrases are used to identify and describe these foods including light or lite , lean , no calorie , low calorie , low fat , no fat , fat free , no sugar , sugar free , and zero calorie . 
3	In some areas use of these terms may be regulated by law .

8	Food and Drug Administration The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low calorie substitute for some high calorie ingredient . 
9	This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food 's sugar with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as Coca-Cola ( for example Diet Coke ) . 
10	In some snacks , the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the calories . 
11	In other cases , low fat ingredients may be used as replacements . 
12	In whole grain foods , the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour . 
13	Since certain fibers have no calories , this results in a modest caloric reduction . 
14	Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-calorie ingredients , such as resistant starch or dietary fiber , to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant caloric reduction .
