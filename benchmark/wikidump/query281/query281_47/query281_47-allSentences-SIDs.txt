2	the episode of the American version of The Office Weight Loss ( The Office ) Weight loss , in the context of medicine , health or physical fitness , is a reduction of the total body mass , due to a mean loss of fluid , body fat or adipose tissue and/or lean mass , namely bone mineral deposits , muscle , tendon and other connective tissue . 
3	It can occur unintentionally due to an underlying disease or can arise from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state . 
4	Unintentional weight loss occurs in many diseases and conditions , including some very serious diseases such as cancer , AIDS , and a variety of other diseases . 
5	Poor management of type 1 diabetes mellitus , also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM) , leads to an excessive amount of glucose and an insufficient amount of insulin in the bloodstream . 
6	This triggers the release of triglycerides from adipose ( fat ) tissue and catabolism ( breakdown ) of amino acids in muscle tissue . 
7	This results in a loss of both fat and lean mass , leading to a significant reduction in total body weight . 
8	Untreated type 1 diabetes mellitus can produce weight loss. 
9	In addition to weight loss due to a reduction in fat and lean mass , fluid loss can be triggered by illnesses such as diabetes , certain medications , lack of fluid intake or other factors . 
10	Fluid loss in addition to reduction in fat and lean mass exacerbates the risk for cachexia .

71	Attention to diet in particular can be beneficial in reducing the impact of diabetes and other health risks of an overweight or obese individual . 
72	August 2011 Weight loss occurs when an individual is in a state of negative thermodynamic flux : when the body is exerting more energy ( i .e 
73	. 
74	in work and metabolism ) than it is consuming ( i .e 
75	. 
76	from food or other nutritional supplements ) , it will use stored reserves from fat or muscle , gradually leading to weight loss . 
77	August 2011 It is not uncommon for some people who are currently at their ideal body weight to seek additional weight loss in order to improve athletic performance , and/or meet required weight classification for participation in a sport . 
78	However , others may be driven by achieving a more attractive body image . 
79	Notably , being underweight is associated with health risks such as difficulty fighting off infection , osteoporosis , decreased muscle strength , trouble regulating body temperature and even increased risk of death .

88	March 4 , 2007 There are many diet plans and recipes that can be helpful for weight loss . 
89	While some are classified as unhealthy and potentially harmful to one 's general health , others are recommended by specialists . 
90	Diet plans are generally designed according to the recommended caloric intake but it is important to note that the most successful diets are those that simultaneously promote physical activity . 
91	August 2011 There are many dietary programs that claim to be efficient in helping overweight individuals to lose weight with no effort . 
92	However , the long-term efficacy of these plans is questionable . 
93	December 2011 Intentional weight loss is , in most cases , achieved with the help of diets since dietary restriction is generally more manageable than making a significant change in one 's lifestyle ( although weight loss is generally associated with some degree of change in lifestyle habits ) or beginning to practice a sport . 
94	August 2011 In that regard , a wide variety of dietary strategies have been designed to meet the needs of individuals seeking to lose excess weight . 
95	Calorie -restriction strategies are one of the most common dietary plans . 
96	Notably , daily calorie consumption for dietary purposes vary depending on a number of factors including , age , gender , weight loss goals , and many more . 
97	For instance , nutritionists suggest that a minimum of 1,200 daily calories should be consumed by women in order to maintain health . 
98	The daily calorie consumption by men , on the other hand , could approach 1,500 .

104	However , individuals whose obesity places them at an increased risk for diabetes , heart disease , or other conditions , may follow a stricter diet , but only under the close monitoring of a physician and/or specialist . 
105	In some cases , obese individuals may need to restrict their daily calorie intake to 800 or even 500 . 
106	According to the U.S. 
107	Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , healthy individuals seeking to maintain their weight , should consume 2,000 calories per day .

110	The 2000 Calorie Diet - and the RDAs 2010-07-19 According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , , which was released on January 31 , 2011 , those that achieve and manage a healthy weight do so most successfully by being continuously vigilant in taking in only the amount of calories that meet their needs and with physical activity . 
111	Low-calorie regimen diets are also referred to as balanced percentage diets . 
112	Due to their minimal detrimental effects , these types of diets are most commonly recommended by nutritionists . 
113	In addition to restricting calorie intake , a balanced diet also regulates macronutrient consumption . 
114	Therefore , from the total number of allotted daily calories , 55 % should come from carbohydrates , 15 % from protein , and 30 % from fats with no more than 10 % of total fat coming from saturated forms .

117	1200 Calorie Diet 2010-07-19 For instance , a 1,200 calorie diet would consist of no more than 660 calories from carbohydrates , 180 from protein , and 360 from fat . 
118	Although counting calories seems difficult altogether , the long term benefits of calorie restriction are many . 
119	After reaching the desired body weight , the amount of calories consumed per day may be increased gradually , without exceeding 2,000 net ( i .e 
120	. 
121	derived by subtracting calories burned by physical activity from calories consumed ) . 
122	Combined with increased physical activity , low-calorie diets are thought to be most effective long term , unlike crash diets which can achieve short term results , at best . 
123	Physical activity could greatly enhance the efficiency of a diet . 
124	The healthiest weight loss regimen , therefore , is one that consists of a balanced diet and moderate physical activity . 
125	The golden rule in weight loss is to avoid foods that are high in sugars August 2011 , which contribute to increased body mass and are detrimental to the overall health . 
126	Further , weight gain has been associated with excessive alcohol consumption . 
127	August 2010 Depression , stress or boredom may also contribute to weight increase , August 2010 and in these cases , individuals are advised to seek medical help . 
128	A 2010 study found that dieters who got a full night 's sleep more than doubled the amount of fat loss compared to sleep-deprived dieters .

146	Other methods of weight loss include use of drugs and supplements that decrease appetite , block fat absorption , or reduce stomach volume . 
147	Application of such medications , however , should only be performed under the strict supervision of a physician and/or specialist . 
148	Finally , surgery ( i .e 
149	. 
150	bariatric surgery ) may be used in more severe cases to artificially reduce the size of the stomach , thus limiting the intake of food energy . 
151	Dietary supplements , though widely used , are not considered a healthy option for weight loss . 
152	Even though a wide array of these products is available to the public , very few are effective long term . 
153	Bariatric surgery is usually considered a last resort in treating severe obesity and it consists of two main procedures : gastric bypass and gastric banding . 
154	Virtual gastric band uses hypnosis to make the brain think the stomach is smaller than it really is and hence lower the amount of food ingested . 
155	This brings as a consequence weight reduction . 
156	This method is complemented with psychological treatment for anxiety management and with hypnopedia .
