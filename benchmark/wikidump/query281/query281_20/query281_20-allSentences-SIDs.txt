1	In most cases dieting is used in combination with physical exercise to lose weight in those who are overweight or obese .

6	Some athletes , however , follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle ) . 
7	Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight . 
8	Diets to promote weight loss are generally divided into four categories : low-fat , low-carbohydrate , low-calorie , and very low calorie .

13	A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types ( low calorie , low carbohydrate , and low fat ) , with a 2–4 kilogram weight loss in all studies . 
14	At two years , all calorie-reduced diet types cause equal weight loss irrespective of the macronutrients emphasized .

27	The first popular diet was " Banting " , named after William Banting . 
28	In his 1863 pamphlet , Letter on Corpulence , Addressed to the Public , he outlined the details of a particular low-carbohydrate , low-calorie diet that had led to his own dramatic weight loss .

31	Wolin Obesity ( Biographies of Disease ) Greenwood Westport , Conn 2009 11 0-313-35275-5 Low-fat diet Low-fat diets involve the reduction of the percentage of fat in one 's diet . 
32	Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed . 
33	Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II . 
34	A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2–12&nbsp;months ' duration found that low-fat diets ( without intentional restriction of caloric intake ) resulted in average weight loss of 3.2&nbsp;kg 
35	( 7.1&nbsp;lb 
36	) over habitual eating . 
37	Low-carbohydrate diet Low carbohydrate diets such as Atkins and Protein Power are relatively high in protein . 
38	Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ketogenic ( i .e 
39	. 
40	they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause ketosis ) . 
41	Calorie restriction Low-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500–1,000 calories per day , which can result in a 0.5&nbsp;kilogram 
42	( 1.1&nbsp;lb 
43	) to 1&nbsp;kilogram ( 2.2&nbsp;lb 
44	) weight loss per week . 
45	Amongst some of the most commonly used low-calorie diets include DASH diet , Diet to Go , and Weight Watchers . 
46	The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets . 
47	They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8 % in the short term , over 3–12 months . 
48	Very low calorie diet Very low calorie diets provide 200–800 calories per day , maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates . 
49	They subject the body to starvation and produce an average weekly weight loss of 1.5–2.5&nbsp;kilograms 
50	( 3.3–5.5&nbsp;lb 
51	) . 
52	"2-4-6-8" , a popular diet of this variety , follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day , 400 the second day , 600 the third day , 800 the fourth day , and then the cycle repeats . 
53	These diets are not recommended for general use as they are associated with adverse side effect such as loss of lean muscle mass , increased risks of gout , and electrolyte imbalance . 
54	People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications . 
55	Each pound of body fat is maintained by less than one extra calorie per hour . 
56	In general , obesity is not a condition maintained by overeating ; obesity is a condition brought about and maintained by eating a few too many calories , consistently . 
57	As a practical example , eating twenty-five hamburgers a year that are Burger King Whoppers rather than twenty-five McDonald Quarter Pounders can cause a weight gain of more than one and one-half pounds in that year . 
58	Twenty-five hamburgers represent 2 % of yearly allotment of three meals a day . 
59	Making comparable choices at every meal for one year could yield an eighty-two-pound difference in body weight .

63	. 
64	Detox diet Detox diets claim to eliminate undesirable " toxins " from the human body rather than claiming to cause weight loss . 
65	Many of these use herbs and other homeopathic remedies , such as dandelion root ( for liver filtering ) and celery and other juicy low - calorie vegetables ( for salt absorption ) . 
66	Weight loss typically involves the loss of fat , water and muscle . 
67	Overweight people , or people suffering from obesity , typically aim to reduce the percentage of body fat . 
68	Additionally , as muscle tissue is denser than fat , fat loss results in increased loss of body volume compared with muscle loss . 
69	Reducing even 10 % body fat can therefore have a dramatic effect on a person 's body shape . 
70	To determine the proportion of weight loss that is due to decreased fat tissue , various methods of measuring body fat percentage have been developed . 
71	Muscle loss during weight loss can be restricted by regularly lifting weights ( or doing push-ups and other strength-oriented calisthenics ) and by maintaining sufficient protein intake . 
72	Those on low-carbohydrate diets , and those doing particularly strenuous exercise , may wish to increase their protein intake . 
73	According to the National Academy of Sciences , the Dietary Reference Intake for protein is 0.8&nbsp;grams 
74	per kilogram of body weight for adults . 
75	Excessive protein intake , though not connected to declined kidney functioning in healthy individuals , http ://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/25 
76	http ://www.annals 
77	.org/content/138/6/460.abstract

85	?identifier=11234 High-Protein Diets American Heart Association 2007-05-24 There is no conclusive evidence that moderately high protein diets in healthy individuals are dangerous ; it has only been shown that these diets are dangerous in individuals already suffering from kidney and liver problems . 
86	The Basal Metabolic Rate , which is the amount of calories the body expends at rest , meaning without performing any physical activity , is influenced by the person 's total weight and total amount of muscle . 
87	The more muscle , the more calories a person can burn naturally . 
88	When the amount of muscle is increased , then more calories can be ingested without gaining weight . 
89	Conversely , if the amount of fat is increased , increasing the number of calories ingested will only add weight .

92	BMR and Fat Loss Vs Muscle Loss 2010-07-26 Normally , when people lose weight , they lose a combination of fat and muscle . 
93	If the diet plan includes a daily caloric intake greater than the basal metabolic rate ( BMR) , the person will most likely lose fat . 
94	In contrast , if the person follows a diet that includes a lower caloric intake than the BMR , this person will lose fat but also a higher percentage of muscle . 
95	April 2011 Severe diets may make people lose 50 % fat and 50 % muscle weight thus affecting their metabolism because by losing muscle the BMR is affected . 
96	Maintaining muscle mass while losing fat is therefore a key factor to reach both the ideal weight and body composition . 
97	To achieve this goal , experts advise not to reduce carbohydrates aggressively . 
98	Fat can be lost by reducing the calorie intake by 20 % of daily needs for two days . 
99	August 2010 This reduced calorie intake , even in the presence of 100 % carbohydrate consumption , allows for reduction of fat without muscle loss because the glycogen in the muscle is properly replenished .

102	Keys to losing fat without losing muscle 2010-07-26 Exercising on days when the highest amount of carbohydrates is consumed , 1.5 
103	to 2 hours after eating , is also helpful to achieve a balanced fat reduction in the absence of muscle loss . 
104	Within this window of time , sugar and insulin levels are undergoing a slow decline . 
105	When insulin levels start dropping , the pancreas then produces the hormone glucagon while releasing nutrients stored in the fat cells to the blood to be turned into energy . 
106	Conversely , if blood sugar levels suffer a high increase , insulin feeds the muscle cells and deposits excess into fat cells . 
107	Furthermore , if insulin levels decrease too much , the muscle cells do not receive the appropriate amount of food they require . 
108	There should always be a meal left during the day after exercising to allow the muscles to recover from exercise . 
109	The energy intake from food is limited by the efficiency of digestion and the efficiency of utilization . 
110	The efficiency of digestion is largely dependent on the type of food being eaten , while efficiency of utilization is affected by a variety of factors , including age , gender , body weight , hormone levels , and many more . 
111	Chewing , especially in the elderly , has been shown to increase the intake of micronutrient . 
112	However , the effect of chewing on the intake of macronutrient , such as sugars , fats , and proteins has not been observed .

114	Oxford University Press , 1997 . 
115	Food provides nutrients from six broad classes : protein , fat , carbohydrate , vitamin , dietary mineral , and water . 
116	Carbohydrates are metabolized to provide energy . 
117	Proteins provide amino acid , which are required for cell construction , especially for the construction of muscle cells . 
118	Essential fatty acid are required for brain and cell membrane construction . 
119	Vitamins and trace minerals helps to keep good electrolyte balance and are used for metabolic processes . 
120	Dietary fiber also affects one 's health , although it 's not digested into the body . 
121	The National Academy of Sciences and the World Health Organization publish guidelines for dietary intakes of all known essential nutrients . 
122	Sometimes dieters will ingest excessive amounts of vitamin and mineral supplements . 
123	While this is usually harmless , some nutrients are dangerous . 
124	Men ( and women who do n't menstruate ) need to be wary of iron poisoning . 
125	August 2010 Retinol ( oil-soluble vitamin A) is toxic in large doses . 
126	Vitamin E supplements have been found in some studies to increase mortality , congenital heart defects in offspring and an increased risk of stroke ( see the corresponding article ) . 
127	August 2010 Most people can obtain their nutritional needs from their diet . 
128	In any event , a multivitamin taken once a day will suffice for the majority of the population . 
129	Weight loss diets that manipulate the proportion of macronutrients ( low-fat , low-carbohydrate , etc. 
130	) have not been shown to be any more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions ( e .g 
131	. 
132	low-fat milk , or less salad dressing ) . 
133	http ://www.aafp.org/afp/20030201/cochrane 
134	.html 
135	Extreme diets may , in some cases , lead to malnutrition . 
136	Besides the importance of eating a balanced diet that includes all the necessary nutrients , other factors also contribute to healthy nutrition . 
137	As well , drinking sufficient amounts of water can help eliminate toxins and fat . 
138	September 2010 Heavily processed and fried foods as well as sweets , junk foods , and alcohol should also be avoided in a healthy diet .

141	Nutrition 2010-07-26 Also a topic of great importance discussed among nutritionists as well as psychologists is the attitude to weight-loss and the consumption of food in general . 
142	Voicing ideas such as "it 's just one burger " during and after weight loss regimes is discouraged , and often is said on the part of an insecure individual who has reached the unfortunate conclusion that nothing can be done any longer and that any effort to do so is futile . 
143	The advice given is , avoid reaching such a conclusion , as not only does it change one 's perception of the effect of excessive amounts of food on the body , but also encourages a 'lack-lustre ' lifestyle and approach to life as a whole . 
144	Nutritionists also agree on the importance of avoiding fats , especially saturated fats , to reduce weight and to be healthier . 
145	They also agree on the importance of reducing salt intake because commercial foods such as snacks , biscuits , and bread , among others , already contain salt , thus contributing to an excess of salt daily intake .

159	Dietary Guidelines 2010-07-26 All body processes require energy in order to function properly . 
160	When the body is expending more energy than it is consuming ( e .g 
161	. 
162	when exercising ) , the body 's cells rely on internally stored energy sources , such as complex carbohydrates and fats , for energy . 
163	The first source to which the body turns is glycogen ( by glycogenolysis ) . 
164	Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate , 65 % of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder , in the liver ( totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body ) . 
165	It is created from the excess of ingested macronutrients , mainly carbohydrates . 
166	When glycogen is nearly depleted , the body begins lipolysis , the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy . 
167	In this process , fats , obtained from adipose tissue , or fat cells , are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids , which can be used to generate energy . 
168	The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water ; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system . 
169	Fats are also secreted by the sebaceous gland ( in the skin ) . 
170	Cognitive Behavior Therapy has been effective in producing long term weight loss .

178	p 51-58 ( 2005 ) Some weight loss groups aim to make money , others work as charities . 
179	The former include Weight Watchers and Peertrainer . 
180	The latter include , Overeaters Anonymous , also several groups run by local churches , hospitals , and like-minded individuals . 
181	These organizations ' customs and practices differ widely . 
182	Some groups are modelled on twelve-step program , while others are quite informal . 
183	Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus , while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking . 
184	A 2008 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that dieters who kept a daily food diary ( or diet journal ) , lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log , suggesting that if you write your food down , you would n't eat as many calories .

191	July 8 , 2008 USA Today Nanci Hellmich May 1 , 2010 Accordingly , diet journal software and websites have gained significant popularity , and help people track calorie consumption , calorie burning , weight loss goals , and nutritional balance . 
192	Certain medications can be prescribed to assist in weight loss . 
193	The most recent prescription weight loss medication released is Acomplia ( generic name Rimonabant ) , manufactured by Sanofi Aventis . 
194	Used to treat obesity in persons with a BMI ( body mass index ) of 30 or above , as well as for smoking cessation treatments , Acomplia is still pending FDA approval for use in the United States . 
195	Other weight loss medications , like amphetamine , are dangerous and are now banned for casual weight loss . 
196	Some supplements , including those containing vitamin and minerals , may not be effective for weight loss . 
197	Diuretic induce weight loss through the excretion of water . 
198	Diuretics , which can be used in the forms of medications , supplements , or herb , reduce overall body weight , but have no effect on an individual 's total body fat content . 
199	Diuretics can thicken the blood , cause cramping , kidney and liver damage . 
200	In a single report , the death of Jacqueline Henson was found to be related to swelling in her brain , which was associated with excessive water consumption over a short period of time , while she was on a special water diet . 
201	Stimulant such as ephedrine , green tea , caffeine or synephrine work to increase the basal metabolic rate . 
202	July 2009 Fasting Lengthy fasting can be dangerous due to the risk of malnutrition and should be carried out under medical supervision . 
203	During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diet , the reduction of blood glucose , the preferred energy source of the brain , causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores . 
204	Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones , while also metabolizing body protein ( including but not limited to skeletal muscle ) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body . 
205	Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting although some dispute this . 
206	The use of short-term fasting , or various forms of intermittent fasting have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue . 
207	Dieting , especially extreme food-intake reduction and rapid weight loss , can have the following side effects and consequences : Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets Many studies have focused on diets that reduce calories via a low-carbohydrate ( Atkins diet , Scarsdale diet , Zone diet ) diet versus a low-fat diet ( LEARN diet , Ornish diet ) . 
208	The Nurses ' Health Study , an observational cohort study , found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease .

274	18165339 Bantle JP Wylie-Rosett J Albright AL Apovian CM Clark NG Franz MJ Hoogwerf BJ Lichtenstein AH " The glycemic index ( GI ) factor is a ranking of foods based on their overall effect on blood sugar levels . 
275	The diet based around this research is called the Low GI diet . 
276	Low glycemic index foods , such as lentils , provide a slower , more consistent source of glucose to the bloodstream , thereby stimulating less insulin release than high glycemic index foods , such as white bread .

358	PDF 2006 : Diets 2 and 3 lost the most weight and fat mass ; however , low density lipoprotein fell in Diet 2 and rose in Diet 3. 
359	Thus the authors concluded that the high-carbohydrate , low-glycemic index diet was the most favorable . 
360	A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that low glycemic index or low glycemic load diets led to more weight loss and better lipid profiles . 
361	However , the Cochrane Collaboration grouped low glycemic index and low glycemic load diets together and did not try to separate the effects of the load versus the index .
