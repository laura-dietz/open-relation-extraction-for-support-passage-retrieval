Bits from the ( chilly ) release team A desire to contribute back to the free-software community ( practically all applicants are users of free software ) A desire to see some specific software task accomplished ( some view the Debian user community as a valuable testing or proving ground for new software ) A desire to make , or keep , free software competitive with proprietary alternatives A desire to work closely with people who share some of their aptitudes , interests , and goals ( there is a very strong sense of community within the Debian project which some applicants do not experience in their paid jobs ) A simple enjoyment of the iterative process of software development and maintenance It must have been in unstable for the appropriate length of time ( the exact duration depends on the "urgency " of the upload ) It must not have a greater number of "release-critical " bugs filed against it than the current version in testing . 	872
