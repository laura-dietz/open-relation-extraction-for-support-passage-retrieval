124	The APT package management system , repositories with large numbers of packages , and strict policies regarding packages , promote high quality releases , easy upgrades between releases , and automated installation and removal of packages . 
125	dpkg is the base of the Debian package management system . 
126	dpkg is a command-line utility to install , remove , and provide information about local .deb

133	packages but also fetching and installing dependencies from online repositories . 
134	GDebi can be used both in a graphical interface and by command-line . 
135	APT expands the functionality of dpkg by searching , fetching and installing packages from online repositories along with their dependencies , either from binary files or by compiling source code . 
136	It can also upgrade packages and upgrade the whole distribution to a new release . 
137	A Debian Live system is a version of Debian that can be booted directly from removable media ( CDs , DVDs , USB keys ) or via netboot without having to install it on the hard drive .

284	Debian 2008-08-13 outlining his view for the new operating system . 
285	In it he called for the creation of a distribution to be maintained in an open manner , in the spirit of Linux and GNU . 
286	The Debian Project grew slowly at first and released the first 0.9x 
287	versions in 1994 and 1995 . 
288	During this time it was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation 's GNU Project .

297	2011-07-27 The first ports to other , non - i386 architectures began in 1995 , and the first 1.x 
298	version of Debian was released in 1996 . 
299	In 1996 , Bruce Perens replaced Ian Murdock as the project leader . 
300	In the same year , Perens read a discussion between fellow developer Ean Schuessler and Donnie Barnes of Red Hat , suggesting that Red Hat had no stated social contract with its users which guaranteed the future freedom of the system 's contents . 
301	Perens decided to create a social contract for Debian , created a first draft , and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion on the Debian mailing lists into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines , defining fundamental commitments for the development of the distribution . 
302	He also initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization , Software in the Public Interest . 
303	Perens developed the project from 40 to 200 developers . 
304	He broke apart the "base system" , the core packages of Debian , which had been maintained by Murdock alone , and distributed them to many maintainers . 
305	He led the conversion of the project from a.out 
306	to ELF . 
307	He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy , and wrote a new installer . 
308	Perens was also responsible for many policy and design elements of Debian that persist to this day .Perens 
309	left the project in 1998 . 
310	The Project elected new leaders and made two more 2.x 
311	releases , each including more ports and packages . 
312	The Advanced Packaging Tool was deployed during this time and the first port to a non - Linux kernel , Debian GNU/Hurd , was started . 
313	The first Linux distribution based on Debian , namely Libranet , Corel Linux and Stormix 's Storm Linux , were started in 1999 . 
314	The 2.2 
315	release in 2000 was dedicated to Joel Klecker , a developer who died of Duchenne muscular dystrophy .

323	, the " Joel 'Espy ' Klecker " release , is officially released Debian .org 
324	2000-08-15 2011-07-27 In late 2000 , the project made major changes to archive and release management , reorganizing software archive processes with new "package pools " and creating a testing distribution as an ongoing , relatively stable staging area for the next release . 
325	In the same year , developers began holding an annual conference called DebConf with talks and workshops for developers and technical users . 
326	In July 2002 , the Project released version 3.0, 
327	codenamed woody , ( each Debian release is named after a character in the movie Toy Story ) , a stable release which would see relatively few updates until the following release . 
328	The long release cycle employed by the Debian Project during this time drew considerable criticism from the free software community January 2012 , and this triggered the creation of Ubuntu in 2004 , to date one of the more influential Debian forks . 
329	The 3.1 
330	sarge release was made in June 2005 . 
331	There were many major changes in this release , mostly due to the long time it took to freeze and release the distribution . 
332	Not only did this release update over 73 % of the software shipped in the prior version , but it also included much more software than prior releases , almost doubling in size with more than 9,000 new packages .

342	Chapter 2 - What 's new in Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 
343	Debian 2010-08-05 A new installer replaced the aging boot-floppies installer with a modular design . 
344	This allowed advanced installations ( with RAID , XFS and LVM support ) including hardware detection , making installations easier for novice users . 
345	The installation system also boasted full internationalization support as the software was translated into almost forty languages . 
346	An installation manual and comprehensive release notes were released in ten and fifteen different languages respectively . 
347	This release included the efforts of the Debian- Edu/ Skolelinux , Debian-Med and Debian- Accessibility sub-projects which raised the number of packages that were educational , had a medical affiliation , and ones made for people with disabilities . 
348	In 2006 , as a result of a much-publicized dispute , Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian , with Firefox becoming Iceweasel , Thunderbird becoming Icedove , along with other Mozilla programs . 
349	The Mozilla Corporation stated that Debian may not use the Firefox trademark if it distributes Firefox with modifications which have not been approved by the Mozilla Corporation . 
350	Two prominent reasons that Debian modifies the Firefox software are to change the artwork , and to provide security patches . 
351	Debian Free Software Guidelines consider Mozilla 's artwork non-free . 
352	Debian provides long term support for older versions of Firefox in the stable release , where Mozilla prefers that old versions are not supported . 
353	These software programs developed largely by the Mozilla Corporation were rebranded despite having only minor differences in the source code .

359	( etch ) was released April 8 , 2007 for the same number of architectures as in sarge . 
360	It included the AMD64 port but dropped support for m68k . 
361	The m68k port was , however , still available in the unstable distribution . 
362	There were approximately 18,200 binary packages maintained by more than 1,030 Debian developers . 
363	Debian 5.0 
364	( lenny ) was released February 14 , 2009 after 22 months of development . 
365	It includes more than 25,000 software packages . 
366	Support was added for Marvell 's Orion platform and for netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC .

398	2011-02-06 2011-02-06 thumb300pxDiagram of the organizational structure of the project The Debian Project is a volunteer organization with three foundational documents : Currently , the project includes more than a thousand developers . 
399	Each of them sustains some niche in the project , be it package maintenance , software documentation , maintaining the project infrastructure , quality assurance , or release coordination . 
400	Package maintainers have jurisdiction over their own packages , although packages are increasingly co-maintained . 
401	Other tasks are usually handled by the domain of smaller , more collaborative groups of developers . 
402	The project maintains official mailing list and conferences for communication and coordination between developers .

411	The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ : Getting support for Debian GNU/Linux Debian 2008-05-12 For issues with single packages or domains , a public bug tracking system is used by developers and end-users . 
412	Informally , Internet Relay Chat channels ( primarily on the OFTC and freenode networks ) are used for communication among developers and users also . 
413	Together , the Developers may make binding general decisions by way of a General Resolution or election . 
414	All voting is conducted by Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping , a Condorcet method of voting . 
415	A Project Leader is elected once per year by a vote of the Developers ; in April 2010 , Stefano Zacchiroli was voted into this position , succeeding Steve McIntyre . 
416	The Debian Project Leader has several special powers , but this power is far from absolute and is rarely used . 
417	Under a General Resolution , the Developers may , among other things , recall the leader , reverse a decision by him or his delegates , and amend the constitution and other foundational documents . 
418	The Leader sometimes delegates authority to other developers in order for them to perform specialized tasks . 
419	Generally this means that a leader delegates someone to start a new group for a new task , and gradually a team gets formed that carries on doing the work and regularly expands or reduces their ranks as they think is best and as the circumstances allow . 
420	A role in Debian with a similar importance to the Project Leader 's is that of a Release Manager . 
421	Release Managers set goals for the next release , supervise the processes , and make the final decision as to when to release .

471	Software packages in development are either uploaded to the project distribution named unstable ( also known as sid ) , or to the experimental repository . 
472	Software packages uploaded to unstable are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original upstream developer , but with the added Debian- specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers . 
473	These additions may be new and untested . 
474	Software not ready yet for the unstable distribution is typically placed in the experimental repository .

479	2007-05-24 The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ Chapter 6 : The Debian FTP archives Debian After a version of a software package has remained in unstable for a certain length of time ( depending on the urgency of the software 's changes ) , that package is automatically migrated to the testing distribution . 
480	The package 's migration to testing occurs only if no serious ( release-critical ) bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in testing . 
481	Since updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features , some choose to use the testing and unstable distributions for their newer packages . 
482	However , these distributions are less tested than stable , and unstable does not receive timely security updates . 
483	In particular , incautious upgrades to working unstable packages can sometimes seriously break software functionality .

507	2009-02-07 thumb300pxFlowchart of the life cycle of a Debian package Each Debian software package has a maintainer who keeps track of releases by the "upstream " authors of the software and ensures that the package is compliant with Debian Policy , coheres with the rest of the distribution , and meets the standards of quality of Debian . 
508	In relations with users and other developers , the maintainer uses the bug tracking system to follow up on bug reports and fix bugs . 
509	Typically , there is only one maintainer for a single package , but , increasingly , small teams of developers " co-maintain " larger and more complex packages and groups of packages .

514	2008-12-13 General Resolution : Endorse the concept of Debian Maintainers Debian Periodically , a package maintainer makes a release of a package by uploading it to the "incoming " directory of the Debian package archive ( or an "upload queue " which periodically batch-transmits packages to the incoming directory ) . 
515	Package uploads are automatically processed to ensure that they are well-formed ( all the requisite files are in place ) and that the package is digitally signed by a Debian developer using OpenPGP -compatible software . 
516	All Debian developers have individual cryptographic key pairs .

523	2010-10-09 Debian Developer 's Reference Debian Packages are signed to be able to reject uploads from hostile outsiders to the project , and to permit accountability in the event that a package contains a serious bug , a violation of policy , or malicious code . 
524	If the package in incoming is found to be validly signed and well-formed , it is installed into the archive into an area called the "pool " and distributed every day to hundreds of mirrors worldwide . 
525	Initially , all package uploads accepted into the archive are only available in the "unstable " suite of packages , which contains the most up-to-date version of each package . 
526	However , new code is also untried code , and those packages are only distributed with clear disclaimers . 
527	For packages to become candidates for the next " stable " release of the Debian distribution , they first need to be included in the "testing " suite .

538	2008-11-24 Debian "testing " distribution Debian Thus , a release-critical bug in a package on which many packages depend , such as a shared library , may prevent many packages from entering the testing area , because that library is considered deficient . 
539	Periodically , the Release Manager publishes guidelines to the developers in order to ready the release , and in accordance with them eventually decides to make a release . 
540	This occurs when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in the release-candidate suite for all architectures for which a release is planned , and when any other goals set by the Release Manager have been met . 
541	At that time , all packages in the release-candidate suite ( "testing " ) become part of the released suite ( "stable " ) . 
542	It is possible for a package : particularly an old , stable , and seldom-updated one : to belong to more than one suite at the same time . 
543	The suites are simply collections of pointers into the package "pool " mentioned above . 
544	The Debian Project , being free software , handles security policy through public disclosure rather than through security through obscurity . 
545	Many advisories are coordinated with other free software vendors ( Debian is a member of vendor-sec ) and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public . 
546	Debian has a security audit team that reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs . 
547	Debian also participates in security standardization efforts : the Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) dictionary , and Debian is represented in the Board of the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language ( OVAL ) project .

627	Time-based freezes are intended to allow the Debian Project to blend the predictability of time based releases with its policy of feature based releases . 
628	The new freeze policy aims to provide better predictability of releases for users of the Debian distribution , and to allow Debian developers to do better long-term planning . 
629	Debian developers expect that a two-year release cycle will give more time for disruptive changes , reducing inconveniences caused for users . 
630	Having predictable freezes was expected to reduce overall freeze time . 
631	The squeeze cycle was intended to be especially short to "get into the new cycle " .

656	Due to an incident involving a CD vendor who made an unofficial and broken release labeled 1.0 
657	, an official 1.0 
658	release was never made . 
659	The Debian Project offers three distributions , each with different characteristics . 
660	The distributions include packages which comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines ( DFSG) , which are included inside the main repositories .

678	2009-12-29 In accordance with its guidelines , a relatively small number of packages are excluded from the distributions ' main repositories and included inside the non-free and contrib repositories . 
679	These two repositories are not officially part of Debian GNU/ Linux . 
680	These are other repositories available in Debian : These repositories are not part of the Debian Project , they are maintained by third party organizations . 
681	They contain packages that are either more modern than the ones found in stable or include packages that are not included in the Debian Project for a variety of reasons such as : e.g 
682	. 
683	alleged possible patent infringement , binary-only/no sources , or special too restrictive licenses . 
684	Their use requires precise configuration of the priority of the repositories to be merged ; otherwise these packages may not integrate correctly into the system , and may cause problems upgrading or conflicts between packages from different sources . 
685	The Debian Project discourages the use of these repositories as they are not part of the project . 
686	Debian provides repositories of more than twenty nine thousand installable packages . 
687	Any of the repositories can be added or modified by directly editing the files in /etc/apt/sources .list 
688	or modifying the settings in APT front-ends .

720	Meeting Minimum Hardware Requirements 2008-10-31 Debian A 1&nbsp;GHz processor is the minimum recommended for desktop systems . 
721	The real minimum memory requirements are much less than the numbers listed in this table . 
722	Depending on the architecture , it is possible to install Debian with as little as 20 MB RAM for s390 or 48 MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 . 
723	Similarly , disk space requirements , which depend on the packages to be installed , can also be reduced . 
724	(embedded Debian ) improves installation to devices with minimal disk space , partially by removing documentation and installing only needed translations . 
725	In its Grip and Baked form it is binary compatible . 
726	It is possible to run graphical user interface on older or low-end systems , but it is recommended to install window manager instead of desktop environment , which are more resource-intensive . 
727	For example , the LXDE desktop environment was released with lenny and has much lower processor and memory usages compared with GNOME or KDE Plasma Desktop . 
728	Depending on the nature of the server , RAM and disk space requirements can vary widely . 
729	As of the current stable release , the official ports are : http ://www.debian

734	Due to its failure to meet the release criteria , it was dropped before the release of etch . 
735	The arm ( OABI ) , alpha and hppa ports were dropped before the release of squeeze . 
736	Many distributions use one of Debian 's branches as a base .

769	In May 2008 , a Debian Developer revealed his discovery that changes made in 2006 to the random number generator in the version of the openSSL package distributed with Debian and other Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu or Knoppix , made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack .

801	Wichert Akkerman 1999-06-21 The internal dissent in the Debian Project regarding the non-free section has persisted , but the last time it came to a vote in 2006 , a large majority decided to keep it .

806	General Resolution : Status of the non-free section 2009-09-28 Debian During the release cycles of Woody and Sarge , the Debian Project drew considerable criticism from the free software community because of the long time between stable releases . 
807	This triggered the creation of Ubuntu in 2004 . 
808	Ubuntu has releases every 6 months which are forks of Debian 's unstable distribution with bug fixes and other modifications . 
809	However , it may be more appropriate to compare Debian releases ( which continue to be supported after the release of subsequent versions ) to Ubuntu 's Long Term Support releases ( which are supported for five years for servers and also for five years for desktops starting with Ubuntu 12.04 
810	LTS ) ; Ubuntu Wiki : Ubuntu produces a new LTS release every two years , which is therefore similar to Debian 's new two-year release cycle for post- Debian 6.0 
811	releases . 
812	When in need of updated versions of software , it is possible to use Debian testing instead of stable as it usually contains more modern , though slightly less stable packages . 
813	Another alternative is to use Debian backports , which are "recompiled packages from testing ( mostly ) and unstable ( in a few cases only , e.g 
814	. 
815	security updates ) , so they will run without new libraries ( wherever it is possible ) on a stable Debian distribution " .

872	Bits from the ( chilly ) release team A desire to contribute back to the free-software community ( practically all applicants are users of free software ) A desire to see some specific software task accomplished ( some view the Debian user community as a valuable testing or proving ground for new software ) A desire to make , or keep , free software competitive with proprietary alternatives A desire to work closely with people who share some of their aptitudes , interests , and goals ( there is a very strong sense of community within the Debian project which some applicants do not experience in their paid jobs ) A simple enjoyment of the iterative process of software development and maintenance It must have been in unstable for the appropriate length of time ( the exact duration depends on the "urgency " of the upload ) It must not have a greater number of "release-critical " bugs filed against it than the current version in testing . 
873	Release -critical bugs are those bugs which are considered serious enough that they make the package unsuitable for release . 
874	It must be compiled for all release architectures the package claims to support ( e .g. 
875	: the i386-specific package gmod can be included in "testing " ) All of its dependencies must either be satisfiable by packages already in testing , or be satisfiable by the group of packages which are going to be installed at the same time . 
876	The operation of installing the package into testing must not break any packages currently in testing . 
877	lenny A A 11 architectures + 1 additional ARM binary ABI ( armel ) squeeze B B 9 architectures with Linux kernel + 2 architectures with kernel of FreeBSD stable , currently aliased squeeze , is the current release that has stable and well-tested software . 
878	Stable is made by freezing testing for a few months where bugs are fixed to make the distribution as stable as possible ; then the resulting system is released as stable . 
879	It is updated only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated . 
880	After Debian 6.0, 
881	new releases will be made every two years . 
882	Stable 's CDs and DVDs can be found in the Debian web site . 
883	testing , currently aliased wheezy , is what the next major release will be and is currently being tested . 
884	The packages included in this distribution have had some testing in unstable but they may not be completely fit for release yet . 
885	It contains more modern packages than stable but older than unstable . 
886	This distribution is updated continually until it enters the "frozen " state . 
887	Security updates for testing distribution are provided by Debian testing security team . 
888	Testing 's CDs and DVDs can be found on the Debian web site . 
889	unstable , permanently aliased sid , repository contains packages currently under development ; it is updated continually . 
890	This repository is designed for Debian developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available , or for those who like to "live on the edge" , therefore it will not be as stable as the other distributions . 
891	There are no official CDs /DVDs because it is rapidly changing and the project does not support it , although CD and DVD images of sid are built quarterly by aptosid . 
892	Additionally , the other two distributions can be upgraded to unstable . 
893	non-free : repositories include packages which do not comply with the DFSG ( this does usually not include legally questionable packages , like libdvdcss ) .
