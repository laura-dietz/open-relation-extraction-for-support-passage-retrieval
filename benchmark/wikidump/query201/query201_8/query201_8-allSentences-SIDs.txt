81	2010-10-31 The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software collaboration : the underlying source code may be used , modified , and distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under licenses such as the GNU General Public License . 
82	Typically Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use . 
83	Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include Debian ( and its derivatives such as Ubuntu ) , Fedora and openSUSE . 
84	Linux distributions include the Linux kernel , supporting utilities and libraries and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution 's intended use . 
85	A distribution oriented toward desktop use may include the X Window System and an accompanying desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . 
86	Other distributions may include a less resource intensive desktop such as LXDE or Xfce for use on older or less powerful computers . 
87	A distribution intended to run as a server may omit all graphical environments from the standard install and instead include other software such as the Apache HTTP Server and an SSH server such as OpenSSH . 
88	Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone can create a distribution for any intended use . 
89	Applications commonly used with desktop Linux systems include the Mozilla Firefox web browser , the OpenOffice .org 
90	and LibreOffice office application suites , and the GIMP image editor . 
91	Because the main supporting user space system tools and libraries orginated in the GNU Project , initiated in 1983 by Richard Stallman , the Free Software Foundation prefers the name GNU/Linux .

104	2009-04-17 History of Linux The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at AT&T 's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , Douglas McIlroy , and Joe Ossanna . 
105	It was first released in 1971 and was initially entirely written in assembly language , a common practice at the time . 
106	Later , in a key pioneering approach in 1973 , Unix was re-written in the programming language C by Dennis Ritchie ( with exceptions to the kernel and I/O ) . 
107	The availability of an operating system written in a high-level language allowed easier portability to different computer platforms . 
108	With a legal glitch forcing AT&T to license the operating system 's source code to anyone who asked , http ://www.faqs

115	In 1984 , AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs . 
116	Free of the legal glitch requiring free licensing , Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product .

125	2008-06-23 2009-03-09 Later , in 1985 , Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) in 1989 . 
126	By the early 1990s , many of the programs required in an operating system ( such as libraries , compiler , text editor , a Unix shell , and a windowing system ) were completed , although low-level elements such as device driver , daemons , and the kernel were stalled and incomplete .

163	He began to work on his own operating system which eventually became the Linux kernel . 
164	Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX , and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux . 
165	Later Linux matured and further Linux development took place on Linux systems .

174	GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components , because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU project with the fledgling operating system . 
175	( Code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other projects as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license . 
176	) In order to make Linux available for commercial use , Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license , which prohibited commercial redistribution , to the GNU GPL .

290	10 November 2011 Finally , individuals and corporations develop third-party non - GNU components . 
291	These third-party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries . 
292	Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel , GNU components , and non - GNU components , with additional package management software in the form of Linux distribution . 
293	section August 2011 A Linux -based system is a modular Unix-like operating system . 
294	It derives much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s . 
295	Such a system uses a monolithic kernel , the Linux kernel , which handles process control , networking , and peripheral and file system access . 
296	Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while the system is running . 
297	Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system 's higher-level functionality . 
298	The GNU userland is an important part of most Linux -based systems , providing the most common implementation of the C library , a popular shell , and many of the common Unix tool which carry out many basic operating system tasks . 
299	The graphical user interface ( or GUI) used by most Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System . 
300	section August 2011 User interface Users operate a Linux -based system through a command line interface ( CLI) , a graphical user interface ( GUI) , or through controls attached to the associated hardware , which is common for embedded systems . 
301	For desktop systems , the default mode is usually a graphical user interface , by which the CLI is available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console . 
302	Most low-level Linux components , including the GNU userland , use the CLI exclusively . 
303	The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks , and provides very simple inter-process communication . 
304	A graphical terminal emulator program is often used to access the CLI from a Linux desktop . 
305	A Linux system typically implements a CLI by a shell , which is also the traditional way of interacting with a Unix system . 
306	A Linux distribution specialized for servers may use the CLI as its only interface . 
307	On desktop systems , the most popular user interfaces are the extensive desktop environment KDE Plasma Desktop , GNOME , and Xfce , Debian popularity-contest program information http ://times .debian

311	though a variety of additional user interfaces exist . 
312	Most popular user interfaces are based on the X Window System , often simply called " X" . 
313	It provides network transparency and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application . 
314	Manual page for " X " ( xorg-docs 1:1.4-4 
315	on Debian ) Other GUIs may be classified as simple X window manager , such as FVWM , Enlightenment , and Window Maker , which provide a minimalist functionality with respect to the desktop environments . 
316	A window manager provides a means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows , and interacts with the X Window System . 
317	The desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations ( Mutter for GNOME , Kwin for KDE , Xfwm for Xfce as of January 2012 ) although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred .

320	Linux shares similar architecture and concepts ( as part of thePOSIXstandard ) but does not share non-free source code with the original UnixorMINIX . 
321	Linux distribution The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open source software . 
322	Linux is not the only such operating system , although it is by far the most widely used .

330	The most common free software license , the GNU GPL , is a form of copyleft , and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU project .

354	17 September 2011 Free software projects , although developed in a collaborative fashion , are often produced independently of each other . 
355	The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution , however , provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution . 
356	A Linux distribution , commonly called a "distro" , is a project that manages a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection . 
357	This allows the user to adapt the operating system to his/her specific needs . 
358	Distributions are maintained by individuals , loose-knit teams , volunteer organizations , and commercial entities . 
359	A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel , general system security , and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole . 
360	Distributions typically use a package manager such as dpkg , Synaptic , YAST , or Portage to install , remove and update all of a system 's software from one central location . 
361	Free software community Linux User Group A distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities . 
362	Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis , Debian being a well-known example . 
363	Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions , as Red Hat does with Fedora and Novell does with openSUSE . 
364	In many cities and regions , local associations known as Linux User Group ( LUGs ) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software . 
365	They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations , training , technical support , and operating system installation to new users . 
366	Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers . 
367	Most distributions and free software / open source projects have IRC chatrooms or newsgroup . 
368	Online forum are another means for support , with notable examples being LinuxQuestions .org 
369	and the various distribution specific support and community forums , such as ones for Ubuntu , Fedora , and Gentoo . 
370	Linux distributions host mailing list ; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list . 
371	There are several technology websites with a Linux focus . 
372	Print magazine on Linux often include cover disk including software or even complete Linux distributions .

387	2008-01-17 Linux Magazine Although Linux distributions are generally available without charge , several large corporations sell , support , and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of free software . 
388	An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations , leaving about 18 percent to the traditional , open source community .

393	75 % of Linux code now written by paid developers APC 2010-01-22 Some of the major corporations that contribute include Dell , IBM , HP , Oracle , Sun Microsystems ( now part of Oracle ) , Novell , and Nokia . 
394	A number of corporations , notably Red Hat and Novell , have built a significant business around Linux distributions . 
395	The free software licenses , on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based , explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization ; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as symbiotic . 
396	One common business model of commercial suppliers is charging for support , especially for business users . 
397	A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution , which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks . 
398	Another business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware . 
399	This used to be the norm in the computer industry , with operating systems such as CP/M , Apple DOS and versions of Mac OS prior to 7.5 
400	freely copyable ( but not modifiable ) . 
401	As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s , it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic , as the OS would run on any manufacturer 's computer that shared the same architecture . 
402	Most Linux distributions support dozens of programming language . 
403	The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the GNU toolchain , which includes the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) and the GNU build system . 
404	Amongst others , GCC provides compilers for Ada , C , C++ , Java , and Fortran . 
405	First released in 2003 , the Low Level Virtual Machine project provides an alternative open-source compiler for many languages . 
406	Proprietary compilers for Linux include the Intel C++ Compiler , Sun Studio , and IBM XL C / C++ Compiler . 
407	BASIC in the form of Visual Basic is supported in such forms as Gambas , FreeBASIC , and XBasic . 
408	Most distributions also include support for PHP , Perl , Ruby , Python and other dynamic languages . 
409	While not as common , Linux also supports C# (via Mono ) , Vala , and Scheme . 
410	A number of Java Virtual Machine and development kits run on Linux , including the original Sun Microsystems JVM ( HotSpot ) , and IBM 's J2SE RE , as well as many open-source projects like Kaffe and JikesRVM . 
411	GNOME and KDE are popular desktop environment and provide a framework for developing applications . 
412	These projects are based on the GTK+ and Qt widget toolkit , respectively , which can also be used independently of the larger framework . 
413	Both support a wide variety of languages . 
414	There are a number of Integrated development environment available including Anjuta , Code : :Blocks , CodeLite , Eclipse , Geany , ActiveState Komodo , KDevelop , Lazarus , MonoDevelop , NetBeans , Qt Creator and Omnis Studio , while the long-established editors Vim and Emacs remain popular .

417	?tid=63&tid=47 2006-12-16 As well as those designed for general purpose use on desktops and servers , distributions may be specialized for different purposes including : computer architecture support , embedded systems , stability , security , localization to a specific region or language , targeting of specific user groups , support for real-time applications , or commitment to a given desktop environment . 
418	Furthermore , some distributions deliberately include only free software . 
419	Currently , over three hundred distributions are actively developed , with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use .

430	Specialized distributions exist for less mainstream architectures . 
431	The ELKS kernel fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16-bit microprocessors , while the µClinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit . 
432	The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system , such as Macintosh computers ( with both PowerPC and Intel processors ) , PDAs , video game console , portable music players , and mobile phone . 
433	There are several industry associations and hardware conferences devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux , such as FreedomHEC . 
434	Desktop Linux The popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years . 
435	Currently most distributions include a graphical user environment , with the two most popular environments being GNOME ( which can utilize additional shells such as the default GNOME Shell and Ubuntu Unity ) , and the KDE Plasma Desktop . 
436	The performance of Linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic ; for example in 2007 Con Kolivas accused the Linux community of favoring performance on servers . 
437	He quit Linux kernel development because he was frustrated with this lack of focus on the desktop , and then gave a "tell all " interview on the topic .

441	Projects such as Upstart and systemd aim for a faster boot time . 
442	Many popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems . 
443	For example Mozilla Firefox , OpenOffice .org 
444	/ LibreOffice and Blender have downloadable versions for all major operating systems . 
445	Furthermore , some applications were initially developed for Linux , such as Pidgin , and GIMP , and were ported to other operating systems including Windows and Mac OS X due to their popularity . 
446	In addition , a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on Linux ; http ://www.iist

451	In the field of animation and visual effects , most high end software , such as Autodesk Maya , Softimage XSI and Apple Shake , is available for Linux , Windows and/or Mac OS X . 
452	There are also several companies that have ported their own or other companies ' games to Linux . 
453	Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux . 
454	Commonly , either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system , or that application will have a version that works on Linux , such as with Skype and some video games . 
455	May 2011 Furthermore , the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux . 
456	CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office , Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks , Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2 , and many popular games such as World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2 .

473	Using Linux For Recording &amp; Mastering 2008-02-03 James Daniel February 2004 Sound On Sound SOS Publications Group there is equivalent software available on Linux . 
474	The collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform language localization of some Linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be cost-effective . 
475	For example the Sinhalese language version of the Knoppix distribution was available significantly before Microsoft Windows XP was translated to Sinhalese . 
476	April 2009 In this case the Lanka Linux User Group played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors , linguist , and local developers . 
477	Installing , updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the Synaptic Package Manager , PackageKit , and Yum Extender . 
478	While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories , often containing tens of thousands of packages , not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories . 
479	Alternatively , users can install packages from unofficial repositories , download pre-compiled packages directly from websites , or compile the source code by themselves . 
480	All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty ; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users , but it 's hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux .
