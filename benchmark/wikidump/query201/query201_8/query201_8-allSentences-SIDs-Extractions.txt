737	Richard Stallman Richard Stallman 2007-03-03 2007-03-12 Free Software Foundation The media and common usage , however , refers to this family of operating systems simply as Linux , as do many large Linux distributions ( e .g 
738	. 
739	SUSE Linux and Mandriva Linux ) . 
740	Some distributions , notably Debian , use GNU/Linux .
