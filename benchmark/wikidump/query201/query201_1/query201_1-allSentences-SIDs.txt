21	Dongle computer lets kids discover programming on a TV 2011-07-11 Bush Steve 2011-05-25 Electronics Weekly The design is based around a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC , which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700&nbsp;MHz processor , VideoCore IV GPU , and 128 or 256&nbsp; megabyte ( MiB ) of RAM. 
22	The design does not include a built-in hard disk or solid-state drive , instead relying on a SD card for booting and long-term storage . 
23	This board is intended to run Linux based operating systems . 
24	Development of the device is undertaken by the Raspberry Pi Foundation , a charitable organization registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales . 
25	Its aim is to "promote the study of computer science and related topics , especially at school level , and to put the fun back into learning computing .

107	UK computing charity opts to manufacture product abroad January 20 , 2012 Weakley , Kirsty Civil Society Media rather than in the UK. 
108	This is because import duty is payable on individual components but not on finished products . 
109	Chinese manufacturers also quoted a lead time of 4 weeks , compared to 12 weeks in the UK. 
110	Savings can be reinvested in the Foundation 's research and development activities . 
111	The foundation plans to release two models at launch . 
112	Model A will have 128&nbsp; MiB RAM memory , one USB port and no Ethernet controller , and will cost US$ 25 , while model B will contain 256&nbsp; MiB RAM memory , two USB ports and a 10/100 Ethernet controller and will cost US$ 35 . 
113	Though the Model A does n't have an RJ45 Ethernet port , it can connect to a network by using a user supplied USB Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter . 
114	As typical of modern computers , generic USB keyboard and mice are compatible with the Raspberry Pi . 
115	The Raspberry Pi will use the Linux operating system . 
116	Debian GNU/Linux , Iceweasel , Calligra Suite and Python are planned to be bundled with the Raspberry Pi . 
117	The Raspberry PI does not come with a real-time clock , so an OS must use a network time server , or ask the user for time information at boot time to get access to time and date info for file time and date stamping . 
118	However a real time clock ( such as the DS1307 ) with battery backup can be easily added via the I2C interface . 
119	In the UK enquiries about the board have been received from schools in both the state and independent sectors , with around five times as much interest from the latter ( January 2012 ) . 
120	It is hoped that businesses will sponsor purchases for less advantaged schools .
