4	These are commonly known as bouillon cube , as cooking base in the US , or as Oxo cubes in Britain , after a common brand of stock cube sold there . 
5	The difference between broth and stock is one of both cultural and colloquial terminology but certain definitions prevail .Stock 
6	is the thin liquid produced by simmering raw ingredients : solids are removed , leaving a thin , highly-flavoured liquid . 
7	This gives classic stock as made from beef , veal , chicken , fish and vegetable stock .

14	Fresh meat makes a superior stock and cuts rich in connective tissue such as shin or shoulder of beef or veal are commonly recommended , either alone or added in lower proportions to the remains of cooked poultry to provide a richer and fresher-tasting stock . 
15	Quantities recommended are in the ratio of 1 part fresh meat to 2 parts water . 
16	Pork is considered unsuitable for stock in European cooking due to its greasiness ( although 19th century recipes for consomme and traditional aspic included slices of mild ham ) and mutton was traditionally avoided due to the difficulty of avoiding the strong tallowy taint imparted from the fat . 
17	Bone Veal , beef , and chicken bones are most commonly used . 
18	The flavour of the stock comes from the cartilage and connective tissue in the bones . 
19	Connective tissue has collagen in it , which gets converted into gelatin that thickens the liquid . 
20	Stock made from bones needs to be simmered for longer than stock made from meat . 
21	Pressure cooking methods shorten the time necessary to extract the flavour from the bones . 
22	Mirepoix A combination of onions , carrots , celery , and sometimes other vegetables . 
23	Often the less desirable parts of the vegetables ( such as carrot skins and celery ends ) are used since they will not be eaten . 
24	Herbs and spices The herbs and spices used depend on availability and local traditions . 
25	In classical cuisine , the use of a bouquet garni ( or bundle of herbs ) consisting of parsley , bay leaves , a sprig of thyme , and possibly other herbs , is common . 
26	This is often placed in a sachet to make it easier to remove once the stock is cooked . 
27	Chicken stock should be cooked for 3–4 hours . 
28	Fish stock is made with fish bones and finely chopped mirepoix . 
29	Fish stock should be cooked for 30–45 minutes—cooking any longer spoils the flavour . 
30	Concentrated fish stock is called "fish fumet . 
31	" In Japanese cooking , a fish and kelp stock called dashi is made by briefly ( 3–5 minutes ) cooking skipjack tuna ( bonito ) flakes called katsuobushi in nearly boiling water . 
32	Fond blanc , or white stock , is made by using raw bones and white mirepoix . 
33	Chicken bones are the most common for fond blanc . 
34	Fond brun , or brown stock . 
35	The brown color is achieved by roasting the bones and mirepoix . 
36	This also adds a rich , full flavour . 
37	Veal bones are the most common type used in a fond brun . 
38	Tomato paste is often added ( sometimes thinned tomato paste is painted onto the roasting bones ) . 
39	The acid in the paste helps break down the connective tissue helping accelerating the formation of gelatin , as well as giving color to the stock . 
40	Glace viande is stock made from bones , usually from veal , that is highly concentrated by reduction . 
41	Ham stock , common in Cajun cooking , is made from ham hock . 
42	Jus is a rich , lightly reduced stock used as a sauce for roasted meats . 
43	Many of these are started by deglazing the roasting pan , then reducing to achieve the rich flavour desired . 
44	Lamb stock should be cooked for 5 hours . 
45	To make a lamb jus , start with a chicken stock and roasted lamb necks and bones . 
46	Master stock is a special Chinese stock used primarily for poaching meats , flavoured with soy sauce , sugar , ginger , garlic , and other aromatic . 
47	Prawn stock is made from boiling prawn shells . 
48	It is used in Southeast Asia dishes such as laksa . 
49	Veal stock should be cooked for 8 hours . 
50	Vegetable stock is made only of vegetables . 
51	The stock ingredients are simmered starting with cold water . 
52	This promotes the extraction of collagen , which may be sealed in by hot water . 
53	Stocks are simmered gently , with bubbles just breaking the surface , and not boiled . 
54	If a stock is boiled , it will be cloudy . 
55	Salt is usually not added to a stock , as this causes it to become too salty , since most stocks are reduced to make soups and sauces . 
56	Meat is added to a stock before vegetables , and the "scum " that rises to the surface is skimmed off before further ingredients are added . 
57	If the cook wants to remove the fat , after the stock is finished it is cooled and the fat which floats , separates , and solidifies into globs within the stock , can be removed with ease . 
58	Stocks can be frozen and kept indefinitely but are better fresh .
