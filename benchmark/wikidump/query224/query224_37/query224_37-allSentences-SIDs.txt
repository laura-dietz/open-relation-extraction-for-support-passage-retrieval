1	Salt , also known as table salt , or rock salt , is a mineral that is composed primarily of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of ionic salts . 
2	It is essential for animal life in small quantities , but is harmful to animals and plants in excess . 
3	Salt is one of the oldest , most ubiquitous food seasonings and salting is an important method of food preservation . 
4	The taste of salt ( saltiness ) is one of the basic human taste . 
5	Salt for human consumption is produced in different forms : unrefined salt ( such as sea salt ) , refined salt ( table salt ) , and iodized salt . 
6	It is a crystalline solid , white , pale pink or light gray in color , normally obtained from sea water or rock deposits . 
7	Edible rock salts may be slightly grayish in color because of mineral content . 
8	Chloride and sodium ions , the two major components of salt , are needed by all known living creatures in small quantities . 
9	Salt is involved in regulating the water content ( fluid balance ) of the body . 
10	The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system .

19	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 97 10 5616–5620 10779552 25877 Schaller KL Lasher RS Peles E Levinson SR Because of its importance to survival , salt has often been considered a valuable commodity during human history . 
20	However , as salt consumption has increased during modern times , scientists have become aware of the health risks associated with too much salt intake , including high blood pressure . 
21	Therefore health authorities have recommended limitations of dietary sodium .

49	Salzach literally means " salt water " and Salzburg " salt city" , both taking their names from the German word for salt , de Salz . 
50	Hallstatt gave its name to the Celt archaeological culture that began mining for salt in the area in around 800 BC . 
51	Around 400 BC , the Hallstatt Celts , who had heretofore mined for salt , began open pan salt making . 
52	During the first millennium BC , Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries .

246	This may indicate an adaptation of humans to low levels of sodium that originated in the predominantly vegetarian diet of human primate ancestors .

250	Some have asserted that while the risks of consuming too much salt are real , the risks have been exaggerated for most people , or that the studies done on the consumption of salt can be interpreted in many different ways .

276	Salt ( as sodium chloride ) contains 39.3 
277	% of sodium by weight . 
278	A 2009 meta-analysis found that the sodium consumption of 19,151 individuals from 33 countries fit into the narrow range of 2,700 to 4,900&nbsp;mg/day . 
279	The small range across many cultures , together with animal studies , suggest that sodium intake is tightly controlled by feedback loops in the body , making recommendations to reduce sodium consumption below 2,700&nbsp;mg/day potentially futile .
