95	Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny , pointed feathers on their necks ( hackles ) and backs ( saddle ) which are typically of brighter , bolder colors than those of females of the same species . 
96	However , in some breeds , such as the Sebright , the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers , the same color as the hen 's . 
97	The identification must be made by looking at the comb , or eventually from the development of spurs on the male 's legs ( in a few breeds and in certain hybrids the male and female chicks may be differentiated by color ) . 
98	Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb , and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles . 
99	Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs , but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.A

101	thumbWildRed Junglefowl Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight , although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances , such as over fences or into trees ( where they would naturally roost ) . 
102	Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings , but generally do so only to flee perceived danger . 
103	Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flock . 
104	They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young . 
105	Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others , establishing a " pecking order " , with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations . 
106	Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established . 
107	Adding hens—especially younger birds—to an existing flock can lead to violence and injury .

112	2010-08-29 Hens will try to lay in nests that already contain eggs , and have been known to move eggs from neighboring nests into their own . 
113	Some farmers use fake eggs made from plastic or stone ( or golf ball ) to encourage hens to lay in a particular location . 
114	The result of this behavior is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations , rather than having a different nest for every bird . 
115	Hens can also be extremely stubborn about always laying in the same location . 
116	It is not unknown for two ( or more ) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time . 
117	If the nest is small , or one of the hens is particularly determined , this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other .

121	Roosters crowing ( a loud and sometimes shrill call ) is a territorial signal to other roosters . 
122	However , crowing may also result from sudden disturbances within their surroundings . 
123	Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg , and also to call their chicks . 
124	Chickens also give a low "warning call " when they think they see a predator approaching . 
125	In 2006 , scientists researching the ancestry of birds "turned on " a chicken recessive gene , talpid2 , and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth , like those found in ancient bird fossils .

131	When a rooster finds food , he may call other chickens to eat first . 
132	He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food . 
133	This behavior may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat . 
134	To initiate courting , some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ( " a circle dance " ) , often lowering his wing which is closest to the hen .

174	The chicken reached Egypt for purposes of cock fighting about 1400 BC , and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt ( about 300 BC ) . 
175	Little is known about the chicken 's introduction into Africa . 
176	Three possible ways of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley , the East Africa Roman -Greek or Indian trade , or from Carthage and the Berbers , across the Sahara .

178	Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion , but blue-egged chicken , found only in the Americas and Asia , suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens . 
179	A lack of data from Thailand , Russia , the Indian subcontinent , Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas ; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area . 
180	thumbrightChickenegg ( biology )eggsvary in color depending on the hen_ typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue_ green _ and recently reported purple ( found in South Asia ) ( Araucanavarieties ) . 
181	thumbrightEarliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo Under natural conditions , most birds lay only until a clutch is complete , and they will then incubate all the eggs . 
182	Many domestic hens will also do this–and are then said to "go broody " . 
183	The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs ( a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs ) . 
184	She will " sit " or " set " on the nest , protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed , and she will rarely leave the nest to eat , drink , or dust-bathe . 
185	While brooding , the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity , as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation . 
186	To stimulate broodiness , an owner may place many artificial eggs in the nest , or to stop it they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor . 
187	At the end of the incubation period ( about 21 days ) , the eggs , if fertile , will hatch . 
188	Development of the egg starts only when incubation begins , so they all hatch within a day or two of each other , despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so . 
189	Before hatching , the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs , and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells . 
190	The chick begins by "pipping " ; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg , usually on the upper side . 
191	The chick will then rest for some hours , absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell ) . 
192	It then enlarges the hole , gradually turning round as it goes , and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid . 
193	It crawls out of the remaining shell , and its wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest . 
194	thumbA day-old chick The hen will usually stay on the nest for about two days after the first egg hatches , and during this time the newly hatched chicks live off the egg yolk they absorb just before hatching . 
195	Any eggs not fertilized by a rooster will not hatch , and the hen eventually loses interest in these and leaves the nest . 
196	After hatching , the hen fiercely guards the chicks , and will brood them when necessary to keep them warm , at first often returning to the nest at night . 
197	She leads them to food and water ; she will call them to edible items , but seldom feeds them directly . 
198	She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old , when she will gradually lose interest and eventually start to lay again . 
199	Modern egg-laying breeds rarely go broody , and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation . 
200	However , some "utility " ( general purpose ) breeds , such as the Cochin , Cornish and Silkie , do regularly go broody , and they make excellent mothers , not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods , such as quail , pheasant , turkey or geese . 
201	Chicken eggs can also be hatched under a broody duck , with varied success . 
202	Poultry farming thumbEgg-laying chicken 5 days out ofbattery cageNote typical paleComb ( anatomy)comb thumbAPastured poultryfree range roosteron a farm More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of food , for both their meat and their eggs . 
203	The vast majority of poultry are raised using intensive farming techniques . 
204	According to the Worldwatch Institute , 74 percent of the world 's poultry meat , and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way . 
205	One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free range farming . 
206	Friction between these two main methods has led to long term issues of ethical consumerism . 
207	Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment , creates human health risks and is inhumane . 
208	Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources due to increased productivity , stating that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities . 
209	In part due to the conditions on intensive poultry farms and recent recalls of large quantities of eggs , there is a growing movement for small scale micro-flocks or 'backyard chickens ' . 
210	This involves keeping small numbers of hens (usually no more than a dozen ) , in suburban or urban residential areas to control bugs , utilize chicken waste as fertilizer in small gardens , and of course for the high-quality eggs and meat that are produced . 
211	Broiler Chickens farmed for meat are called broiler chickens . 
212	Chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years , but broiler chickens typically take less than 6 weeks to reach slaughter size .

223	In total , the UK alone consumes over 29 million eggs per day . 
224	Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year . 
225	After 12 months of laying , the commercial hen 's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is unviable . 
226	Hens , particularly from battery cage systems , are sometimes infirm , have lost a significant amount of their feathers , and their life expectancy has been reduced from around 7 years to less than 2 years .

280	2010-09-30 The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator . 
281	Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch . 
282	Variations of more than 1 °F ( 1.8 
283	°C ) from the optimum temperature of 99.5 
284	°F °C will reduce hatch rates . 
285	Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity . 
286	Evaporation can be assessed by candling , to view the size of the air sac , or by measuring weight loss . 
287	Relative humidity should be increased to around 70 % in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell . 
288	Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation . 
289	The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates . 
290	For best results , eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly ( at least three times per day ) until one to three days before hatching . 
291	If the eggs are n't turned , the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects . 
292	Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen . 
293	Older eggs require increased ventilation . 
294	Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time , with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process . 
295	Home incubators are boxes holding from half a dozen to 75 eggs ; they are usually electrically powered , but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp .

298	Chicken eggs are widely used in many types of dishes , both sweet and savory , including many baked goods . 
299	Eggs can be scrambled , fried , hard-boiled , soft-boiled , pickled , and poached . 
300	The albumen , or egg white , contains protein but little or no fat , and can be used in cooking separately from the yolk . 
301	Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light , fluffy consistency and are often used in desserts such as meringue and mousse . 
302	Ground egg shells are sometimes used as a food additive to deliver calcium . 
303	Some people prefer to just have a female , and raise it for the eggs .

305	The meat of the chicken , also called " chicken" , is a type of poultry meat . 
306	Because of its relatively low cost , chicken is one of the most used meats in the world . 
307	Nearly all parts of the bird can be used for food , and the meat can be cooked in many different ways . 
308	Popular chicken dishes include roasted chicken , fried chicken , chicken soup , Buffalo wings , tandoori chicken , butter chicken , and chicken rice . 
309	Chicken is also a staple of many fast food restaurants . 
310	Chickens as pets Chickens are sometimes kept as pet and can be tamed by hand feeding , but roosters can sometimes become aggressive and noisy , although aggression can be curbed with proper handling . 
311	Some have advised against keeping them around very young children . 
312	Certain breeds , however , such as silkies and many bantam varieties are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities .

324	Providing a Good Home for Chickens United Poultry Concerns 2009-05-04 Chickens are susceptible to several parasite , including lice , mite , tick , flea , and intestinal worm , as well as other diseases . 
325	Despite the name , they are not affected by chickenpox , which is generally restricted to humans .

333	An animal model of varicella virus infection White TM , Gilden DH , Mahalingam R. 
334	2009-05-01 Some of the common diseases that affect chickens are shown below : In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during the Hindu cremation ceremony . 
335	A chicken is considered a channel for evil spirit which may be present during the ceremony . 
336	A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present during the ceremony go into the chicken and not the family members present . 
337	The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life . 
338	In ancient Greece , the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices , perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal . 
339	Because of its valor , the cock is found as an attribute of Ares , Heracles , and Athena . 
340	The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning , as recounted by Plato , were " Crito , I owe a cock to Asclepius ; will you remember to pay the debt ? " , signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life . 
341	The Greeks believed that even lion were afraid of cocks . 
342	Several of Aesop 's Fables reference this belief . 
343	In the New Testament , Jesus prophesied the betrayal by Peter : " Jesus answered , ' I tell you , Peter , before the rooster crows today , you will deny three times that you know me . 
344	'" ( Luke 22:34 ) Thus it happened ( Luke 22:61 ) , and Peter cried bitterly . 
345	This made the cock a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal . 
346	Earlier , Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about Jerusalem : " O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you , how often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you were not willing . 
347	" ( Matthew 23:37 ; also Luke 13:34) . 
348	In many Central Europe folk tale , the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a cock . 
349	In traditional Jewish practice , a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before Yom Kippur , the Day of Atonement , in a ritual called kapparos . 
350	A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available ( and small enough to hold ) . 
351	The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement , for the animal symbolically takes on all the person 's sins in kapparos . 
352	The meat is then donated to the poor . 
353	A woman brings a hen for the ceremony , while a man brings a rooster . 
354	Although not actually a sacrifice in the biblical sense , the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God 's hands . 
355	The Talmud speaks of learning " courtesy toward one 's mate " from the rooster ( Eruvin 100b ) . 
356	This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat , he calls his hens to eat first . 
357	The chicken is one of the Zodiac symbols of the Chinese calendar . 
358	Also in Chinese religion , a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities . 
359	Vegetarian deities such as the Buddha are not one of the recipients of such offerings . 
360	Under some observations , an offering of chicken is presented with " serious " prayer ( while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration ) . 
361	In Confucian Chinese Wedding , a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available ( e .g 
362	. 
363	sudden death ) to attend the ceremony . 
364	A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken 's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed . 
365	However , this practice is rare today . 
366	A cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster , as well as killed by a Rooster 's call . 
367	thumbleftTheRed Junglefowl An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable , since the word for domestic chicken ( *manuk ) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language ( see Austronesian languages ) . 
368	Chickens , together with dogs and pig , were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture , the first Neolithic culture of Oceania . 
369	The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC . 
370	The poet Cratinus ( mid-5th century BC , according to the later Greek author Athenaeus ) calls the chicken " the Persia alarm" . 
371	In Aristophanes 's comedy The Birds ( 414 BC ) a chicken is called " the Median bird" , which points to an introduction from the East . 
372	Pictures of chickens are found on Greek red figure and black-figure pottery . 
373	In ancient Greece , chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia . 
374	Delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding . 
375	The Roman used chickens for oracles , both when flying ( "ex avibus" , Augury ) and when feeding ( "auspicium ex tripudiis" , Alectryomancy ) . 
376	The hen ( "gallina" ) gave a favourable omen ( "auspicium ratum" ) , when appearing from the left ( Cic. 
377	,de Div. 
378	ii .26 
379	) , like the crow and the owl . 
380	For the oracle "ex tripudiis " according to Cicero ( Cic . 
381	de Div. 
382	ii .34) 
383	, any bird could be used , but normally only chickens ( "pulli" ) were consulted . 
384	The chickens were cared for by the pullarius , who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed . 
385	If the chickens stayed in their cage , made noises ( "occinerent " ) , beat their wings or flew away , the omen was bad ; if they ate greedily , the omen was good . 
386	In 249 BC , the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his chickens thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of Drepana , saying " If they wo n't eat , perhaps they will drink . 
387	" He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginian and 93 Roman ships were sunk . 
388	Back in Rome , he was tried for impiety and heavily fined . 
389	In 161 BC , a law was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens . 
390	It was renewed a number of times , but does not seem to have been successful . 
391	Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results . 
392	The Roman gourmet Apicius offers 17 recipes for chicken , mainly boiled chicken with a sauce . 
393	All parts of the animal are used : the recipe include the stomach , liver , testicle and even the pygostyle ( the fatty "tail " of the chicken where the tail feathers attach ) . 
394	The Roman author Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in his eighth book of his treatise on agriculture . 
395	He identifies Tanagrian , Rhodic , Chalkidic and Median ( commonly misidentified as Melian ) breeds , which have an impressive appearance , a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the Greeks . 
396	For farming , native ( Roman ) chickens are to be preferred , or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks . 
397	Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages . 
398	Per Columella , the ideal flock consists of 200 birds , which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals . 
399	White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks . 
400	One cock should be kept for five hens . 
401	In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex , only three hens are kept per cock . 
402	The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood ; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens . 
403	A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs , depending on the time of year , and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings . 
404	Eggs that are long and pointed give more male , rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings . 
405	Per Columella , chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen , as smoke is beneficial for the animals . 
406	Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth . 
407	Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths . 
408	According to Columella , chicken should be fed on barley groats , small chick-peas , millet and wheat bran , if they are cheap . 
409	Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds . 
410	Boiled ryegrass ( Lollium sp. 
411	) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L. 
412	) can be used as well . 
413	Grape marc can be used , but only when the hens stop laying eggs , that is , about the middle of November ; otherwise eggs are small and few . 
414	When feeding grape marc , it should be supplemented with some bran . 
415	Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice , in warm places around the first of January , in colder areas in the middle of February . 
416	Parboiled barley increases their fertility ; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds , or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand . 
417	Free -ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily . 
418	Columella advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years , because they no longer produce sufficient eggs . 
419	Capons were produced by burning out their spurs with a hot iron . 
420	The wound was treated with potter 's chalk . 
421	For the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient Rome see Roman eating and drinking . 
422	Chickens were spread by Polynesia seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD , where they were the only domestic animal , with the possible exception of the Polynesian Rat ( Rattus exulans ) . 
423	They were housed in extremely solid chicken coop built from stone . 
424	An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana , bred in southern Chile by Mapuche people . 
425	Araucanas , some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears , lay blue-green eggs . 
426	It has long been suggested that they predate the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples , particularly the Polynesians and South America . 
427	In 2007 , an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south central Chile . 
428	Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian , and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia . 
429	Brendan Borrell , Nature , 5 June 2007 . 
430	Retrieved 2007-10-01 . 
431	These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus 's arrival in the Americas .

437	; John Noble Wilford , " First Chickens in Americas were Brought from Polynesia , New York Times , June 5 , 2007 . 
438	However , a later report looking at the same specimens concluded : A published , apparently pre-Columbian , Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences , providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America . 
439	In contrast , sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia , Japan , and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal . 
440	Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens , and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia .
