439	In contrast , sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia , Japan , and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal . 
440	Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens , and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia .
