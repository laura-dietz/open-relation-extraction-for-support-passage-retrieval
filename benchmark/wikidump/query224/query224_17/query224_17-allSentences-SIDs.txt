37	Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylon carvings from around 600 BC . 
38	Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages . 
39	It was widely believed to be easily digested and considered to be one of the most neutral foodstuff . 
40	July 2011 It was eaten over most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capon , pullet and hens were eaten . 
41	It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called white dish , a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar . 
42	Chicken consumption in the United States increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork . 
43	, The History Channel . 
44	March 2 , 2007 . 
45	In Europe , consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996 , linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy or B.S.E. 
46	Poultry farming Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross , are bred specifically for meat production , with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal . 
47	The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the US are Cornish and White Rock . 
48	, USDA . 
49	March 2 , 2007 . 
50	Chickens raised specifically for food are called broiler . 
51	In the United States , broilers are typically butchered at a young age . 
52	Modern Cornish Cross hybrids , for example , are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds . 
53	Capon ( castrate cocks ) produce more and fattier meat . 
54	For this reason , they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages . 
55	thumbChicken in a public market Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat than most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage . 
56	Northwestern University . 
57	Retrieved on August 24 , 2009 Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself ( castrated roosters excluded ) , however it is highly concentrated on its skin , which should be avoided when low intake of fat is necessary . 
58	Cooking method is highly related to health issues related to chicken , with steam cooking with skin removed being considered one of the healthiest , and fried with trans fats one of the worst . 
59	However according to a 2006 Harvard School of Public Health study of 135,000 people , people who ate grilled skinless chicken 5 or more times a week had a 52 percent higher chance of developing bladder cancer compared to people who did n’t . 
60	However , such strong associations were not found in individuals regularly consuming chicken with skin intact .

67	2006-12-02 2010-08-19 A recent study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half ( 47 % ) percent of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores were contaminated with S. 
68	aureus , with more than half ( 52 % ) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics .

70	Juvenile chickens , of less than 28 days of age at slaughter in the United Kingdom are marketed as poussin . 
71	Mature chicken is sold as small , medium or large . 
72	Whole mature chickens are marketed in the United States as fryers , broilers , and roasters . 
73	Fryers are the smallest size ( 2.5-4&nbsp;lbs 
74	dressed for sale ) , and the most common , as chicken reach this size quickly ( about 7 weeks ) . 
75	Most dismembered packaged chicken would be sold whole as fryers . 
76	Broilers are larger than fryers . 
77	They are typically sold whole . 
78	Roasters , or roasting hens , are the largest chickens commonly sold ( 3–5 months and 6-8&nbsp;lbs ) and are typically more expensive . 
79	Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially . 
80	The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio . 
81	As the size increases , the volume ( which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked ) increases faster than the surface area ( which determines how fast heat can enter the bird ) . 
82	For a fast method of cooking , such as frying , a small bird is appropriate : frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready . 
83	Chicken is also sold in dismembered pieces . 
84	Pieces may include quarters , or fourths of the chicken . 
85	A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters . 
86	Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken . 
87	A leg quarter contains the thigh , drumstick and a portion of the back ; a leg has the back portion removed . 
88	A breast quarter contains the breast , wing and portion of the back ; a breast has the back portion and wing removed . 
89	Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces , or in combination packages . 
90	Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces . 
91	(8-piece cut ) ; or sometimes without the back . 
92	A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants ) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting . 
93	Pick of the Chicken , or similar titles , refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces . 
94	Typically the breasts , thighs , and legs without wings or back . 
95	Thighs and breasts are sold boneless and/or skinless . 
96	Dark meat ( legs , drumsticks and thighs ) pieces are typically cheaper than white meat pieces ( breast , wings ) . 
97	Chicken livers and/or gizzards are commonly available packaged separately . 
98	Other parts of the chicken , such as the neck , feet , combs , etc . 
99	are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand , or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts . 
100	There are many fast food restaurant chains on both a national and global scale that sell exclusively or primarily in poultry products including KFC ( global ) , Red Rooster ( Australia ) , Hector Chicken ( Belgium ) and CFC ( Indonesia ) . 
101	Most of the products on the menu in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries .

104	Raw chicken can be frozen for up to two years without significant changes in flavor or texture . 
105	Chicken is typically eaten cooked as when raw it often contains Salmonella . 
106	Chicken can be cooked in many ways . 
107	It can be made into sausages , skewered , put in salads , grilled , breaded and deep-fried , or used in various curries . 
108	There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures . 
109	Historically common methods include roasting , baking , broasting , and frying . 
110	Today , chickens are frequently cooked by deep frying and prepared as fast food such as fried chicken , chicken nugget , chicken lollipop or buffalo wings . 
111	They are also often grilled for salads or tacos . 
112	Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster" , which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken . 
113	While these labels are only suggestions , ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods .

116	Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker " with Rib Meat . 
117	" This is a misnomer , as it is the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula , and is removed with the breast meat . 
118	The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut , while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks , for example . 
119	Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices , an easy filling for sandwich . 
120	Often , the tenderloin ( pectoralis minor ) is marketed separately from the breast ( pectoralis major ) . 
121	In the US , "tenders " can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast . 
122	In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called " Chicken mini-fillets " . 
123	Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten , but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock . 
124	In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups , which are said to be healthy . 
125	In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either " chicken frames " or " chicken carcasses " and are purchased for soup or stock purposes . 
126	Raw chicken maintains its quality longer in the freezer as compared to when having been cooked because moisture is lost during cooking . 
127	from USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service . 
128	Last Modified : June 3 , 2010 . 
129	There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage . 
130	For optimal quality , however , a maximal storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for uncooked whole chicken , 9 months for uncooked chicken parts , 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets , and 4 months for cooked chicken . 
131	Freezing does n't usually cause color changes in poultry , but the bones and the meat near them can become dark . 
132	This bone darkening results when pigment seeps through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed . 
133	It is safe to freeze chicken directly in its original packaging , however this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time . 
134	Therefore , for prolonged storage , it is recommended to overwrap these packages . 
135	It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is . 
136	If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer , the food is still safe to use , but it is still recommended to overwrap or rewrap it . 
137	Chicken should be from other foods , so if they begin to thaw , their juices wo n't drip onto other foods . 
138	If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store , it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly . 
139	Chicken can be cooked or reheated from the frozen state , but it will take approximately one and a half times as long to cook , and any wrapping or absorbent paper should be discarded . 
140	In many factory farms , chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive Roxarsone , a relatively benign organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounds in the flesh of chickens , and in their feces , which are often used as a fertilizer . 
141	The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth . 
142	A Consumer Reports study in 2004 reported finding " no detectable arsenic in our samples of muscle " but found " A few of our chicken-liver samples has an amount that according to EPA standards could cause neurological problems in a child who ate 2 ounces of cooked liver per week or in an adult who ate 5.5 
143	ounces per week . 
144	" However , the amounts found in these livers averaged to 460 part per billion ; an amount still less than the 2,000 parts per billion limit set by the FDA.
