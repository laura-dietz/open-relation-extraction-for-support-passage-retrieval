44	The engineering discipline of heat transfer recognizes heat transfer by conduction , by convection , by mass transfer , and by radiation . 
45	Heat transfer by conduction and by radiation from a hotter to a colder body is spontaneous . 
46	The second law of thermodynamics requires that the transfer of energy from one body to another with an equal or higher temperature can only occur with the aid of a heat pump by mechanical work , or by some other similar process in which entropy is increased in the universe in a manner that compensates for the decrease of entropy in the cooled body , due to the removal of the heat from it .

51	For example , energy may be removed against a temperature gradient by spontaneous evaporation of a liquid . 
52	In physics , especially in calorimetry , and in meteorology , the concepts of latent heat and of sensible heat are used . 
53	A related and potentially confusing term is thermal energy , loosely defined as the energy of a body that increases with its temperature . 
54	Potentially confusingly , thermal energy is sometimes referred to as heat , although the thermodynamic definition of heat requires it to be in transfer between two systems or in production in a dissipative process such as friction , viscosity , or chemical reaction . 
55	Heat flows spontaneously only from systems of higher temperature to systems of lower temperature . 
56	When two systems come into thermal contact , they always exchange thermal energy due to the microscopic interactions of their particles . 
57	When the systems are at different temperatures , the net flow of thermal energy is not zero and is directed from the hotter region to the cooler region , until their temperatures are equal and the flow of heat ceases . 
58	Then they have reached a state of thermal equilibrium , exchanging thermal energy at an equal rate in both directions . 
59	The first law of thermodynamics requires that the energy of an isolated system is conserved . 
60	To change the energy of a system , energy must be transferred to or from the system . 
61	For a closed system , heat and work are the mechanisms by which energy can be transferred . 
62	For an open system , total energy can be changed also by transfer of matter .

67	Work performed on a system is , by definition , an energy transfer to the system that is due to a change to external or mechanical parameters of the system , such as the volume , magnetization , center of mass in a gravitational field . 
68	For a closed system ( with no external transfer of matter ) , heat is defined as energy transferred to the system in any way other than as work . 
69	Heat transfer is an irreversible process , which leads to the systems coming closer to mutual thermodynamic equilibrium . 
70	In the case of systems close to thermodynamic equilibrium where temperature can be defined , some heat transfer can be related to temperature difference between systems . 
71	Heat transfer can also arise by friction and by viscosity . 
72	For an open system , far from thermodynamic equilibrium , where temperature cannot be defined , there the distinction between heat and work may not be feasible . 
73	Human notions such as hot and cold are relative terms and are generally used to compare one system’s temperature to another or its surroundings . 
74	175pxthumbHeat may flow across the boundary of thethermodynamic systemsystemand thus change itsinternal energy . 
75	Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell , in his 1871 classic Theory of Heat , was one of the first to enunciate a modern definition of heat . 
76	Maxwell outlined four stipulations for the definition of heat : Several modern definitions of heat are as follows : In a thermodynamic sense , heat is never regarded as being stored within a system . 
77	Like work , it exists only as energy in transit from one system to another or between a system and its surroundings . 
78	When energy in the form of heat is added to a system , it is stored as kinetic and potential energy of the atoms and molecules in the system .

85	Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics McGraw-Hill 2005 ISBN 0073104450 As a form of energy heat has the unit joule ( J) in the International System of Units ( SI) . 
86	However , in many applied fields in engineering the British Thermal Unit ( BTU) and the calorie are often used . 
87	The standard unit for the rate of heat transferred is the watt ( W) , defined as joules per second . 
88	The total amount of energy transferred as heat is conventionally written as Q for algebraic purposes . 
89	Heat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention a negative quantity ( Q &nbsp;&lt ;&nbsp;0 ) ; when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings , it is positive ( Q &nbsp;&gt ;&nbsp;0 ) . 
90	Heat transfer rate , or heat flow per unit time , is denoted by Heat flux is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross-sectional area , resulting in the unit watts per square metre . 
91	There is some diversity of usage of the word heat , even in technical scientific writings .

94	In current scientific usage , the language surrounding the term can be conflicting and even misleading . 
95	One study showed that several popular textbooks used language that implied several meanings of the term , that heat is the process of transferring energy , that it is the transferred energy ( i .e 
96	. 
97	, as if it were a substance ) , and that is an entity contained within a system , among other similar descriptions . 
98	The study determined it was not uncommon for a combination of these representations to appear within the same text .

117	They found the predominant use among physicists to be as if it were a substance . 
118	In the case where the number of particles in the system is constant , the first law of thermodynamics states that the differential change in internal energy dU of a system is given by the differential heat flow δ Q into the system minus the differential work δW exerted by the system : An alternate convention is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings . 
119	This leads to a change in sign of the work . 
120	This is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry , such as those by Peter Atkins and Ira Levine , but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system . 
121	The differential transfer of heat , delta Q_text{in } , makes differential contributions , not only to internal energy , but also to the work done by the system : The work done by the system includes boundary work , which causes the boundaries of the system to expand , in addition to other work ( e .g 
122	. 
123	shaft work performed by a compressor fan ) : mathrm{d } U + delta W_text{boundary } is equal to the differential enthalpy change ( dH ) of the system . 
124	Substitution gives : Both enthalpy , H , and internal energy , U , are state function . 
125	In cyclical processes , such as the operation of a heat engine , state functions return to their initial values . 
126	Thus , the differentials for enthalpy and energy are exact differential , which are dH and dU , respectively . 
127	The symbol for exact differential is the lowercase letter d . 
128	In contrast , neither Q nor W represents the state of the system ( i .e 
129	. 
130	they need not return to their original values when returning to same step in the following cycle ) . 
131	Thus , the infinitesimal expressions for heat and work are inexact differentials , delta Q and delta W , respectively . 
132	The lowercase Greek letter delta , delta , is the symbol for inexact differential . 
133	The integral of any inexact differential over the time it takes to leave and return to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero . 
134	However , for slow enough processes involving no change in volume ( i .e 
135	. 
136	dV = 0 ) , applied magnetic field , or other external parameters ( i .e 
137	. 
138	delta W_text{out } = 0 and delta W_text{in } = 0 ) , delta Q forms the exact differential , dS = frac{delta Q_text{rev} }{ T} , wherein the following relation applies : Likewise , for an isentropic process ( i .e 
139	. 
140	delta Q = 0 and dS = 0 ) , delta W forms the exact differential , dV = frac{delta W_text{rev} }{p } , wherein the following relation applies : For a simple compressible system such as an ideal gas inside a piston , the internal energy change Delta U at constant volume and the enthalpy change Delta H at constant pressure are modeled by separate heat capacity values , which are C_v and C_p , respectively . 
141	Constrained to have constant volume , the heat , Q , required to change its temperature from an initial temperature , T 0 , to a final temperature , T f , is given by this formula : Removing the volume constraint and allowing the system to expand or contract at constant pressure , the heat , Q , required to change its temperature from an initial temperature , T 0 , to a final temperature , T f , is given by this formula : Note that when integrating an exact differential ( e .g 
142	. 
143	mathrm{d } U ) , the lowercase letter d is substituted for Delta ( e .g 
144	. 
145	Delta U ) , and when integrating an inexact differential ( e .g 
146	. 
147	delta W_{boundary } ) , the lowercase Greek letter delta is removed with no replacement ( e .g 
148	. 
149	W_{boundary } ).z 
150	For incompressible substances , such as solid and liquid , the distinction between the two types of heat capacity ( i .e 
151	. 
152	C_p which is based on constant pressure and C_v which is based on constant volume ) disappears , as no work is performed . 
153	In a 1847 lecture entitled On Matter , Living Force , and Heat , James Prescott Joule characterized the terms latent heat and sensible heat as components of heat each effecting distinct physical phenomena , namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles , respectively .

162	.

164	Latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during a change of state that occurs without a change in temperature .

178	Specific heat , also called specific heat capacity , is defined as the amount of energy that has to be transferred to or from one unit of mass ( kilogram ) or amount of substance ( mole ) to change the system temperature by one degree . 
179	Specific heat is a physical property , which means that it depends on the substance under consideration and its state as specified by its properties . 
180	The specific heats of monatomic gases ( e .g. 
181	, helium ) are nearly constant with temperature . 
182	Diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence , and triatomic gases ( e .g. 
183	, carbon dioxide ) still more . 
184	Entropy In 1856 , German physicist Rudolf Clausius defined the second fundamental theorem ( the second law of thermodynamics ) in the mechanical theory of heat ( thermodynamics ) : "if two transformations which , without necessitating any other permanent change , can mutually replace one another , be called equivalent , then the generations of the quantity of heat Q from work at the temperature T , has the equivalence-value : " Published in Poggendoff’s Annalen , Dec.

199	In 1865 , he came to define this ratio as entropy symbolized by S , such that , for a closed , stationary system : and thus , by reduction , quantities of heat δ Q ( an inexact differential ) are defined as quantities of TdS ( an exact differential ) : In other words , the entropy function S facilitates the quantification and measurement of heat flow through a thermodynamic boundary . 
200	To be precise , this equality is only valid , if the heat delta Q is applied reversibly . 
201	If , in contrast , irreversible processes are involved , e.g 
202	. 
203	some sort of friction , then instead of the above equation one has This is the second law of thermodynamics .

205	The discipline of heat transfer , typically considered an aspect of mechanical engineering and chemical engineering , deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated , or converted , or transferred to another system . 
206	Although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy , the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language . 
207	Heat transfer includes the mechanisms of heat conduction , thermal radiation , and mass transfer . 
208	In engineering , the term convective heat transfer is used to describe the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow and is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer . 
209	Although distinct physical laws may describe the behavior of each of these methods , real systems often exhibit a complicated combination which are often described by a variety of complex mathematical methods . 
210	In accordance with the first law , heat may be converted to or from work by so-called heat engine , e.g 
211	. 
212	the steam engine . 
213	Heat engines achieve maximum efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is largest , resulting in minimal loss . 
214	Heat pump on the other hand operate at a small temperature difference , transferring heat at low temperatures from a reservoir , e.g 
215	. 
216	from the soil , and deliver it by means of electrical work for heating purposes . 
217	Now the temperature difference should be small , to keep the lost electrical work small .
