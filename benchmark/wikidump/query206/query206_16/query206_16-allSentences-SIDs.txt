1	A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines , and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles , but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes . 
2	A wind farm may also be located offshore . 
3	Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA . 
4	As of November 2010 , the Roscoe Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the world , with a capacity of 781.5 
5	MW of power , followed by the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center ( 735.5 
6	MW) . 
7	As of November 2010 , the Thanet Offshore Wind Project in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 300 MW , followed by Horns Rev II ( 209 MW) in Denmark . 
8	There are many large wind farms under construction and these include Anholt Offshore Wind Farm ( 400 MW) , BARD Offshore 1 ( 400 MW) , Clyde Wind Farm ( 548 MW) , Greater Gabbard wind farm ( 500 MW) , Lincs Wind Farm ( 270 MW) , London Array ( 1000 MW) , Lower Snake River Wind Project ( 343 MW) , Macarthur Wind Farm ( 420 MW) , Shepherds Flat Wind Farm ( 845 MW) , Sheringham Shoal ( 317 MW) , and the Walney Wind Farm ( 367 MW) . 
9	A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines , and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles , but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes . 
10	A wind farm may be located offshore to take advantage of strong winds blowing over the surface of an ocean or lake . 
11	thumbMap of available wind power over the United States . 
12	Color codes indicate wind power density class As a general rule , economic wind generators require windspeed of 10&nbsp;mph ( 16&nbsp;km/h ) or greater . 
13	An ideal location would have a near constant flow of non-turbulent wind throughout the year , with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind . 
14	An important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or transmission capacity . 
15	Usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas , and validated with wind measurements . 
16	Meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project . 
17	Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential page 32 EWEA 2009 . 
18	Accessed : 13 March 2011 . 
19	in order to finance the project . 
20	Local winds are often monitored for a year or more , and detailed wind maps constructed before wind generators are installed . 
21	The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag . 
22	The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography , surface roughness , and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings . 
23	Typically , the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a wind profile power law , which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude . 
24	Doubling the altitude of a turbine , then , increases the expected wind speeds by 10 % and the expected power by 34 % . 
25	Individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 
26	kV ) power collection system and communications network . 
27	At a substation , this medium-voltage electrical current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system . 
28	Construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation , and possibly access roads to each turbine site .

52	.com/news/view/2111 
53	Onshore turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridgelines generally three kilometers or more inland from the nearest shoreline . 
54	This is done to exploit the topographic acceleration as the wind accelerates over a ridge . 
55	The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines . 
56	The exact position of each turbines matters , because a difference of 30m could potentially double output . 
57	This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting ' .

67	Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land , as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance . 
68	Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water ) , the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water . 
69	Capacity factor (utilisation rates ) are considerably higher than for onshore locations .

144	It is to be built 12 miles off of the Kent coast and will include 341 turbines . 
145	An important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms . 
146	In most locations the wind blows only part of the time , which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing . 
147	To address this issue it has been proposed to create a " supergrid " to connect national grids together across western Europe , ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland , and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world .

272	As well as stealth windfarms , the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference . 
273	In early 2011 , the U.S. 
274	government awarded a program to build a radar/wind turbine analysis tool . 
275	This tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction , thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system .

279	A mobile radar system , the Lockheed Martin TPS-77 , has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines , and more than 170 TPS-77 radars are in use around the world . 
280	In Britain , the Lockheed Martin TPS-77 will be delivered and installed in November 2011 at Trimingham in Norfolk , removing military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the North Sea . 
281	A second TPS-77 is to be installed in the Scottish Borders , overcoming objections to a 48-turbine wind farm at Fallago .

289	shows that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms , the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas . 
290	According to Roy , the effect is due to the turbulence generated by the blades . 
291	In another study conducted by Gene Takle and Julie Lundquist University of Colorado , presented at San Francisco conference of the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting ( December 13–18 , 2010 ) , the analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the United States has noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the spring and autumn frosts , and it reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves . 
292	Even at the height of summer heat , the lowering of 2.5-3 
293	degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades , can make a difference for the cultivation of maize .
