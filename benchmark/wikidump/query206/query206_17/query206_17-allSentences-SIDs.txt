88	Globally , the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production , or 40 times current electricity demand . 
89	This could require wind turbines to be installed over large areas , particularly in areas of higher wind resources . 
90	Offshore resources experience average wind speeds of ~90 % greater than that of land , so offshore resources could contribute substantially more energy . 
91	" Offshore stations experience mean wind speeds at 80 m that are 90 % greater than over land on average .

103	Solar energy is the energy derived from the sun through the form of solar radiation . 
104	Solar powered electrical generation relies on photovoltaics and heat engine . 
105	A partial list of other solar applications includes space heating and cooling through solar architecture , daylighting , solar hot water , solar cooking , and high temperature process heat for industrial purposes . 
106	Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute solar energy . 
107	Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy . 
108	Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun , selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . 
109	Biomass ( plant material ) is a renewable energy source because the energy it contains comes from the sun . 
110	Through the process of photosynthesis , plants capture the sun 's energy . 
111	When the plants are burnt , they release the sun 's energy they contain . 
112	In this way , biomass functions as a sort of natural battery for storing solar energy . 
113	As long as biomass is produced sustainably , with only as much used as is grown , the battery will last indefinitely . 
114	December 2011 Union of Concerned Scientists . 
115	December 2011 In general there are two main approaches to using plants for energy production : growing plants specifically for energy use ( known as first and third-generation biomass ) , and using the residues ( known as second-generation biomass ) from plants that are used for other things .

140	Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth . 
141	Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter . 
142	Earth 's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet ( 20 % ) and from radioactive decay of minerals ( 80 % ) . 
143	The geothermal gradient , which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface , drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface . 
144	The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots geo , meaning earth , and thermos , meaning heat . 
145	The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be stored deep within the Earth , all the way down to Earth’s core – 4,000 miles down . 
146	At the core , temperatures may reach over 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit . 
147	Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock . 
148	Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt , which is commonly known as magma . 
149	Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock . 
150	This magma then heats rock and water in the crust , sometimes up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit Nemzer J Geothermal heating and cooling http ://www.geothermal

493	Renewable energy provides 19 % of electricity generation worldwide . 
494	Renewable power generators are spread across many countries , and wind power alone already provides a significant share of electricity in some areas : for example , 14 % in the U.S. 
495	state of Iowa , 40 % in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein , and 20 % in Denmark . 
496	Some countries get most of their power from renewables , including Iceland and Paraguay ( 100 % ) , Norway (98 % ) , Brazil (86 % ) , Austria ( 62 % ) , New Zealand ( 65 % ) , and Sweden ( 54 % ) .

500	Heating . 
501	Solar hot water makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries , most notably in China , which now has 70 % of the global total ( 180 GWth ) . 
502	Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China . 
503	Worldwide , total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households . 
504	The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well . 
505	In Sweden , national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil . 
506	Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly . 
507	Transport fuels . 
508	Renewable biofuel have contributed to a significant decline in oil consumption in the United States since 2006 . 
509	The 93 billion liters of biofuels produced worldwide in 2009 displaced the equivalent of an estimated 68 billion liters of gasoline , equal to about 5 % of world gasoline production . 
510	Hydroelectric energy is a term usually reserved for large-scale hydroelectric dams . 
511	Examples are the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State and the Akosombo Dam in Ghana . 
512	Micro hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 100&nbsp;k W of power . 
513	They are often used in water rich areas as a remote-area power supply (RAPS) . 
514	Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity systems derive kinetic energy from rivers and oceans without using a dam .
