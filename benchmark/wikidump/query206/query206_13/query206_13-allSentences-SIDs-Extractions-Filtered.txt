Much of the new wind power capacity is being built in the Great Plains and Midwest regions of the United States , which have a favorable combination of characteristics : ample wind resources , an extensive rail and highway network for shipping outsized turbine components , flat topography which both improves the wind and makes turbine components easier to ship , and broad acceptance from local farmers and ranchers . 	98
