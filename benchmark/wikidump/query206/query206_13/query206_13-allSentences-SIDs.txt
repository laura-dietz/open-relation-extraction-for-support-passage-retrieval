229	Wind Power Today 2010 , EERE Wind and Water Program ( pdf ) In August 2011 , a coalition of 24 governors asked the Obama administration to provide a more favorable business climate for the development of wind power , starting with “a seven-year extension of the Production Tax Credit ( PTC ) and the Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) to provide stable , low tax rates for wind-generated electricity” . 
230	The governors said that these measures would help to “drive economic growth , energy development , and the creation of high-paying jobs” .

261	. 
262	However , when appropriate planning procedures for site selection are followed environmental problems should be minimal . 
263	Some people may still object to wind farms , but their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and fossil fuel depletion , the need for energy security , and the opinions of the broader community . 
264	Worldwide experience has shown that community consultation and direct involvement of the general public in wind farm projects has helped to increase community approval , and some wind farms overseas have become tourist attractions . 
265	The U.S. 
266	Department of Energy ’s 2008 report 20 % Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20 % of all U.S. 
267	electricity , which included a contribution of 4 % to the nation’s total electricity from offshore wind power . 
268	However , in order to achieve this , significant advances in cost , performance and reliability are needed , according to a report in 2011 from a coalition of researchers from universities , industry , and government , supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future . 
269	On February 11 , 2010 , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory released the first comprehensive update of the wind energy potential by state since 1993 , showing that the contiguous United States had potential to install 10,459&nbsp;GW of onshore wind power .

323	The United States has very large offshore wind energy resources due to strong , consistent winds off the long U.S.

343	Some coastal residents oppose offshore wind farms because of fears about impacts on marine life , the environment , electricity rates , aesthetics , and recreation such as fishing and boating . 
344	However , residents also cite improved electricity rates , air quality , and job creation as positive impacts they would expect from wind farms .
