1	If the mechanical energy is used to produce electricity , the device may be called a wind generator or wind charger . 
2	If the mechanical energy is used to drive machinery , such as for grinding grain or pumping water , the device is called a windmill or wind pump . 
3	Developed for over a millennium , today 's wind turbines are manufactured in a range of vertical and horizontal axis types . 
4	The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging or auxiliary power on sailing boats ; while large grid-connected arrays of turbines are becoming an increasingly large source of commercial electric power .

49	Brush2008-12-28Danish Wind Industry Association In Denmark by 1900 , there were about 2500 windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills , producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 MW. 
50	The largest machines were on 24 m ft on towers with four-bladed 23 m ft on diameter rotors . 
51	By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators operating in the US from 5&nbsp;k W to 25&nbsp;kW. 
52	Around the time of World War I , American windmill makers were producing 100,000 farm windmills each year , mostly for water-pumping . 
53	By the 1930s , wind generators for electricity were common on farms , mostly in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed . 
54	In this period , high-tensile steel was cheap , and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers . 
55	A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis wind generators was in service at Yalta , USSR in 1931 . 
56	This was a 100&nbsp;k W generator on a 30 m ft on tower , connected to the local 6.3 
57	kV distribution system . 
58	It was reported to have an annual capacity factor of 32 per cent , not much different from current wind machines .

62	The Smith-Putnam wind turbine only ran for 1,100 hours before suffering a critical failure . 
63	The unit was not repaired because of shortage of materials during the war . 
64	The first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the U.K. 
65	was built by John Brown &amp; Company in 1951 in the Orkney Islands .

70	Costa Head Experimental Wind Turbine Anon Orkney Sustainable Energy Website Orkney Sustainable Energy Ltd 19 December 2010 Wind power A quantitative measure of the wind energy available at any location is called the Wind Power Density ( WPD ) It is a calculation of the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine , and is tabulated for different heights above ground . 
71	Calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density . 
72	Color-coded maps are prepared for a particular area described , for example , as " Mean Annual Power Density at 50 Meters . 
73	" In the United States , the results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the U.S. 
74	National Renewable Energy Lab and referred to as " NREL CLASS. 
75	" The larger the WPD calculation , the higher it is rated by class . 
76	Classes range from Class 1 ( 200 watts/square meter or less at 50 meters altitude ) to Class 7 ( 800 to 2000 watts/square meter ) . 
77	Commercial wind farms generally are sited in Class 3 or higher areas , although isolated points in an otherwise Class 1 area may be practical to exploit .

88	Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane , while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servo motor . 
89	Most have a gearbox , which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator .

93	Wind turbine components retrieved November 8 , 2008 Since a tower produces turbulence behind it , the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower . 
94	Turbine blades are made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds . 
95	Additionally , the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount . 
96	Downwind machines have been built , despite the problem of turbulence ( mast wake ) , because they do n't need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind , and because in high winds the blades can be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance . 
97	Since cyclical ( that is repetitive ) turbulence may lead to fatigue failures , most HAWTs are of upwind design .

100	thumbrightTurbine blade convoy passing throughEdenfieldin theUK Turbines used in wind farm for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed and pointed into the wind by computer-controlled motors . 
101	These have high tip speeds of over 320 km/h mph , high efficiency , and low torque ripple , which contribute to good reliability . 
102	The blades are usually colored light gray to blend in with the clouds and range in length from 20 to 40 m ft or more . 
103	The tubular steel towers range from 60 to 90 m ft tall . 
104	The blades rotate at 10-22 revolutions per minute . 
105	At 22 rotations per minute the tip speed exceeds 90 m/s ft/s . 
106	A gear box is commonly used for stepping up the speed of the generator , although designs may also use direct drive of an annular generator . 
107	Some models operate at constant speed , but more energy can be collected by variable-speed turbines which use a solid-state power converter to interface to the transmission system . 
108	All turbines are equipped with protective features to avoid damage at high wind speeds , by feathering the blades into the wind which ceases their rotation , supplemented by brake . 
109	Vertical-axis wind turbine ( or VAWTs ) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically . 
110	Key advantages of this arrangement are that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective . 
111	This is an advantage on sites where the wind direction is highly variable , for example when integrated into buildings . 
112	The key disadvantages include the low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train , the inherently lower power coefficient , the 360 degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade , the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train , and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype . 
113	at the AWS Open-Wind website With a vertical axis , the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground , using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox , hence improving accessibility for maintenance . 
114	When a turbine is mounted on a rooftop , the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine . 
115	If the height of the rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50 % of the building height , this is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence . 
116	It should be borne in mind that wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites .

124	Aerodynamic modelling is used to determine the optimum tower height , control systems , number of blades and blade shape . 
125	Wind turbines convert wind energy to electricity for distribution . 
126	Conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components . 
127	A 1.5 
128	MW wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the United States has a tower 80 meters high . 
129	The rotor assembly ( blades and hub ) weighs 48,000 lbs . 
130	The nacelle , which contains the generator component , weighs 115,000 lbs . 
131	The concrete base for the tower is constructed using 58,000 lbs of reinforcing steel and contains 250 cubic yards ( 190 cubic meters ) of concrete . 
132	The base is 50 ft in diameter and 8 ft thick near the center . 
133	Unconventional wind turbines One E-66 wind turbine at Windpark Holtriem , Germany , carries an observation deck , open for visitors . 
134	Another turbine of the same type , with an observation deck , is located in Swaffham , England . 
135	Airborne wind turbine have been investigated many times but have yet to produce significant energy . 
136	Conceptually , wind turbines may also be used in conjunction with a large vertical solar updraft tower to extract the energy due to air heated by the sun . 
137	Wind turbines which utilise the Magnus effect have been developed . 
138	The Ram air turbine is a specialist form of small turbine that is fitted to some aircraft . 
139	When deployed , the RAT is spun by the airstream going past the aircraft and can provide power for the most essential systems if there is a loss of all on–board electrical power . 
140	thumbuprightA small wind turbine being used inAustralia Small wind turbine Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on - or off-grid residences , telecom towers , offshore platforms , rural schools and clinics , remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid , or where the grid is unstable . 
141	Small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use . 
142	The US Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts . 
143	http ://www.nrel.gov/wind/smallwind/ 
144	Small units often have direct drive generators , direct current output , aeroelastic blades , lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind . 
145	Larger , more costly turbines generally have geared power trains , alternating current output , flaps and are actively pointed into the wind . 
146	Direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched . 
147	On most horizontal windturbine farms , a spacing of about 6-10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld . 
148	However , for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economically optimal , taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs . 
149	This conclusion has been reached by research conducted by Charles Meneveau of the Johns Hopkins University and Johan Meyers of Leuven University in Belgium , based on computer simulations that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines ( wakes ) as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer . 
150	Moreover , recent research by John Dabiri of Caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighboring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another . 
151	Several cases occurred where the housings of wind turbines caught fire . 
152	As housings are normally out of the range of standard fire extinguishing equipment , it is nearly impossible to extinguish such fires on older turbine units which lack fire suppression system . 
153	In several cases one or more blades were damaged or torn away . 
154	In 2010 70 mph kph storm winds damaged some blades , prompting blade removal and inspection of all 25 wind turbines in Campo Indian Reservation in the U.S. 
155	State of California . 
156	Several wind turbines also collapsed . 
157	Severe wind turbine accidents have had relatively low impacts on the communities where the accidents occurred . 
158	In comparison , nuclear accident sites such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters have created emergency evacuation zones the size of Switzerland which will remain in place for many decades , if not centuries .

223	Modern wind turbines Darrieus wind turbine "Eggbeater " turbines , or Darrieus turbines , were named after the French inventor , Georges Darrieus . 
224	http ://www .symscape.com/blog/vertical_axis_wind_turbine 
225	They have good efficiency , but produce large torque ripple and cyclical stress on the tower , which contributes to poor reliability . 
226	They also generally require some external power source , or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning , because the starting torque is very low . 
227	The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor . 
228	Solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area . 
229	Newer Darrieus type turbines are not held up by guy-wire but have an external superstructure connected to the top bearing . 
230	Exploit Nature-Renewable Energy Technologies by Gurmit Singh‏ , Aditya Books , pp 378 Giromill A subtype of Darrieus turbine with straight , as opposed to curved , blades . 
231	The cycloturbine variety has variable pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting . 
232	http ://www.awea.org/faq/vawt

234	The advantages of variable pitch are : high starting torque ; a wide , relatively flat torque curve ; a lower blade speed ratio ; a higher coefficient of performance ; more efficient operation in turbulent winds ; and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses . 
235	Straight , V , or curved blades may be used . 
236	at the Springer Publishing website Savonius wind turbine These are drag-type devices with two ( or more ) scoops that are used in anemometers , Flettner vents ( commonly seen on bus and van roofs ) , and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines . 
237	They are always self-starting if there are at least three scoops . 
238	Twisted Savonius Twisted Savonius is a modified savonius , with long helical scoops to give a smooth torque , this is mostly used as roof windturbine or on some boats ( like the Hornblower Hybrid ) . 
239	The rotor component , which is approximately 20 % of the wind turbine cost , includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy . 
240	The generator component , which is approximately 34 % of the wind turbine cost , includes the electrical generator , the control electronics , and most likely a gearbox ( e .g 
241	. 
242	planetary gearbox , adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission ) component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity . 
243	The structural support component , which is approximately 15 % of the wind turbine cost , includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism .
