23	Renewable Energy Access , 5 June 2007 . 
24	The broad scope and geographical extent of wind farms in Texas is considerable : 47000 acre km² 0 " Wind resource areas in the Texas Panhandle , along the Gulf Coast south of Galveston , and in the mountain passes and ridge tops of the Trans-Pecos offer Texas some of the greatest wind power potential in the United States . 
25	Currently there are over 2,000 wind turbines in West Texas alone . 
26	Most of the new wind capacity added in the last two years has been in the Abilene-Sweetwater area . 
27	The Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center is the largest wind power facility in the nation with a total capacity of 735 MW. 
28	It is spread across approximately 47000 acre km² 0 in Taylor and Nolan County near Abilene .

59	Terrorism and industrial accidents can be potential threats to the large , centrally located , power plants that provide most of Texas ’ electricity . 
60	Should one of these plants be damaged , repairs could take more than a year , possibly creating power shortages on a scale that Texans have never experienced before . 
61	Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption . 
62	However , wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired . 
63	The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged , the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected .

181	The PUC estimates that the new lines will be in service between 2011–2013 , at which point residential customers will be charged about $ 4 per month to pay off the cost of the transmission lines . 
182	The plan included 6,903 MW of existing or already in development wind power capacity , plus 11,553 MW of future capacity . 
183	Additionally , the plan , allows for 2,393 MW of wind power to be transmitted from the so-called " Panhandle B" zone .
