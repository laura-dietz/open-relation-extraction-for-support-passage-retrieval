1	On Earth , wind consists of the bulk movement of air . 
2	In outer space , solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space , while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical element from a planet 's atmosphere into space . 
3	Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale , their speed , the types of forces that cause them , the regions in which they occur , and their effect . 
4	The strongest observed winds on a planet in our solar system occur on Neptune and Saturn . 
5	In meteorology , winds are often referred to according to their strength , and the direction from which the wind is blowing . 
6	Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts . 
7	Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute ) are termed squall . 
8	Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength , such as breeze , gale , storm , hurricane , and typhoon . 
9	Wind occurs on a range of scales , from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes , to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours , to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zone on Earth . 
10	The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles , and the rotation of the planet ( Coriolis effect ) . 
11	Within the tropics , thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations . 
12	In coastal areas the sea breeze /land breeze cycle can define local winds ; in areas that have variable terrain , mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds . 
13	In human civilization , wind has inspired mythology , influenced the events of history , expanded the range of transport and warfare , and provided a power source for mechanical work , electricity and recreation . 
14	Wind powers the voyages of sailing ship across Earth 's oceans . 
15	Hot air balloon use the wind to take short trips , and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption . 
16	Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft . 
17	When winds become strong , trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed . 
18	Winds can shape landforms , via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils , such as loess , and by erosion . 
19	Dust from large desert can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds ; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions . 
20	Wind affects the spread of wildfire . 
21	Winds disperse seeds from various plants , enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species , as well as flying insect populations . 
22	When combined with cold temperatures , wind has a negative impact on livestock . 
23	Wind affects animals ' food stores , as well as their hunting and defensive strategies . 
24	thumbrightsurface weather analysisSurface analysisofGreat Blizzard of 1888 . 
25	Areas with greater isobaric packing indicate higher winds . 
26	Wind is caused by differences in pressure . 
27	When a difference in pressure exists , the air is accelerated from higher to lower pressure . 
28	On a rotating planet , the air will be deflected by the Coriolis effect , except exactly on the equator . 
29	Globally , the two major driving factors of large-scale winds ( the atmospheric circulation ) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles ( difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy force ) and the rotation of the planet . 
30	Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface , the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance . 
31	Near the Earth 's surface , friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise . 
32	Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low pressure areas .

39	Winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the decomposition and analysis of wind profiles . 
40	They are useful for simplifying the atmospheric equations of motion and for making qualitative arguments about the horizontal and vertical distribution of winds . 
41	The geostrophic wind component is the result of the balance between Coriolis force and pressure gradient force . 
42	It flows parallel to isobars and approximates the flow above the atmospheric boundary layer in the midlatitudes .

130	Most ocean basins use the average wind speed to determine the tropical cyclone 's category . 
131	Below is a summary of the classifications used by Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers worldwide : The Enhanced Fujita Scale ( EF Scale ) rates the strength of tornadoes in the United States based on the damage they cause . 
132	Below is that scale . 
133	Minor or no damage . 
134	Peels surface off some roofs ; some damage to gutters or siding ; branches broken off trees ; shallow-rooted trees pushed over . 
135	Confirmed tornadoes with no reported damage ( i .e 
136	. 
137	, those that remain in open fields ) are always rated EF0 . 
138	Moderate damage . 
139	Roofs severely stripped ; mobile homes overturned or badly damaged ; loss of exterior doors ; windows and other glass broken . 
140	Considerable damage . 
141	Roofs torn off well-constructed houses ; foundations of frame homes shifted ; mobile homes completely destroyed ; large trees snapped or uprooted ; light-object missiles generated ; cars lifted off ground . 
142	Severe damage . 
143	Entire stories of well-constructed houses destroyed ; severe damage to large buildings such as shopping malls ; trains overturned ; trees debarked ; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown ; structures with weak foundations are badly damaged . 
144	Extreme damage . 
145	Well-constructed and whole frame houses completely leveled ; cars and other large objects thrown and small missiles generated . 
146	Total Destruction . 
147	Strong-framed , well-built houses leveled off and foundations swept away ; steel-reinforced concrete structures are critically damaged ; tall buildings collapse or have severe structural deformations . 
148	thumbrightWind plotting within a station model The station model plotted on surface weather map uses a wind barb to show both wind direction and speed . 
149	The wind barb shows the speed using "flags " on the end .

167	Total wind energy flowing through an imaginary area A during the time t is : where v is the wind velocity and ρ is the air density . 
168	The formula presented is structured in two parts : ( A·v·t ) is the volume of air passing through A , which is considered perpendicular to the wind velocity ; ( ρ· ½ v 2 ) is the kinetic energy of the moving air per unit volume . 
169	Total wind power is : Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity . 
170	Total wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero . 
171	In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible , as the captured air must also leave the turbine . 
172	A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered . 
173	Using the concept of stream tube , the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59 % of the total theoretical wind power .

179	Further insufficiencies , such as rotor blade friction and drag , gearbox losses , generator and converter losses , reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine . 
180	The basic relation that the turbine power is ( approximately ) proportional to the third power of velocity remains . 
181	Prevailing winds rightthumbThe westerlies and trade winds rightthumbWinds are part of Earth 's atmospheric circulation . 
182	Easterly winds , on average , dominate the flow pattern across the poles , westerly winds blow across the mid-latitudes of the earth , to the north of the subtropical ridge , while easterlies again dominate the tropics . 
183	Directly under the subtropical ridge are the doldrums , or horse latitudes , where winds are lighter . 
184	Many of the Earth 's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge , where descent reduces the relative humidity of the air mass .

259	The westerlies can be particularly strong , especially in the southern hemisphere , where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify , which slows the winds down . 
260	The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties , between 40 and 50&nbsp;degrees latitude south of the equator .

304	Sea and Land Breezes University of Wisconsin 2006-10-24 As the temperature of the surface of the land rises , the land heats the air above it by conduction . 
305	The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises . 
306	This causes a pressure gradient of about 2&nbsp;millibars from the ocean to the land . 
307	The cooler air above the sea , now with higher sea level pressure , flows inland into the lower pressure , creating a cooler breeze near the coast . 
308	When large-scale winds are calm , the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea . 
309	If an offshore wind of us 8 kn km/h exists , the sea breeze is not likely to develop . 
310	At night , the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their specific heat values . 
311	This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate . 
312	When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore , the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land , establishing a land breeze , as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it .

336	In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow , the wind circulation between mountains and valleys is the most important contributor to the prevailing winds . 
337	Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow , deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography , which is known as a barrier jet . 
338	This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45 % .

353	Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land . 
354	If there is a pass in the mountain range , winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure . 
355	The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside .

363	In Europe , similar winds are known as the Bora , Tramontane , and Mistral . 
364	When these winds blow over open waters , they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool , nutrient rich waters to the surface , which leads to increased marine life .

369	The Papaguayo Wind Anthony Drake 2008-02-08 NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center 2009-06-16 In mountainous areas , local distortion of the airflow becomes severe . 
370	Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence , such as rotors , which can be topped by lenticular cloud . 
371	Strong updraft , downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys . 
372	Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge , also known as upslope flow , resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation . 
373	In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds ( for example , the trade winds ) , a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side . 
374	Moisture is removed by orographic lift , leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming , leeward side where a rain shadow is observed .

404	In addition , the wind speed also increases with the altitude . 
405	Nowadays , a yardstick used to determine the best locations for wind energy development is referred to as wind power density ( WPD) . 
406	It is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location , frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time . 
407	It takes into account wind velocity and mass . 
408	Color coded maps are prepared for a particular area are described as , for example , "mean annual power density at 50&nbsp;meters .

647	thumbrightOtto Lilienthalin flight Wind figures prominently in several popular sports , including recreational hang gliding , hot air ballooning , kite flying , snowkiting , kite landboarding , kite surfing , paragliding , sailing , and windsurfing . 
648	In gliding , wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider . 
649	Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launch , also known as winch launches or wire launches . 
650	If the wind gradient is significant or sudden , or both , and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude , the indicated airspeed will increase , possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed . 
651	The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient .

660	/ 2009-06-17 When landing , wind shear is also a hazard , particularly when the winds are strong . 
661	As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing , airspeed decreases while sink rate increases , and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact . 
662	The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it .

684	Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds , spores , pollen , etc . 
685	Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants , it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants . 
686	thumbrightA rock formation in theAltiplano_Bolivia_ sculpted by wind erosion Aeolian processes Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind . 
687	There are two main effects . 
688	First , wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region . 
689	This is called deflation . 
690	Second , these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion ( ecological succession ) . 
691	Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation , often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation . 
692	An example is the formation of sand dunes , on a beach or in a desert .

721	Therefore , windbreaks ( such as big trees and bushes ) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess . 
722	During mid-summer ( July ) , the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean Sea into southeastern North America . 
723	When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land , rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance , which leads to an increase in red sunsets . 
724	Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates .

791	Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms : seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively , they can flutter to the ground .

804	, Massachusetts The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelion ( Taraxacum spp . 
805	, Asteraceae ) , which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances , and maple ( Acer ( genus ) spp . 
806	, Sapindaceae ) , which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground . 
807	An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination . 
808	There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism . 
809	For instance , species in the Asteraceae on island tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities ( i .e 
810	. 
811	, larger seed mass and smaller pappus ) relative to the same species on the mainland .

823	Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweed . 
824	A related process to anemochory is anemophily , which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind . 
825	Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner , which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together .

858	Plants National Park Service 2006-09-01 Department of the Interior 2009-06-20 Wind can also cause plants damage through sand abrasion . 
859	Strong winds will pick up loose sand and topsoil and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from 25–40 miles per hour . 
860	Such windblown sand causes extensive damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells , making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought . 
861	Using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting , scientists affiliated with the Agricultural Research Service studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings . 
862	The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems .

996	2010-01-22 World Meteorological Association The most powerful gusts of wind on Earth were created by nuclear detonations . 
997	The blast wave is similar to a strong wind gust over the ground . 
998	The largest nuclear explosion ( 50–58 megatons at an altitude of about 13,000&nbsp;ft ) generated a 20 bar blast pressure at ground zero , which is similar to a wind gust of 3,100 miles per hour . 
999	Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours . 
1000	For example , burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity , increased temperatures , and increased wind speeds .

1028	2008-08-21 Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology National Wildfire Coordinating Group PDF 2008 2008-12-18 73 The solar wind is quite different from a terrestrial wind , in that its origin is the sun , and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun 's atmosphere . 
1029	Similar to the solar wind , the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres . 
1030	Over long periods of time , the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres . 
1031	Atmospheric escape thumbrightPossible future for Earth due to the planetary wind : Venus The hydrodynamic wind within the upper portion of a planet 's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase , the lower limit of the exosphere , where the gases can then reach escape velocity , entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas . 
1032	This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind .

1050	It consists mostly of electrons and proton with energies of about 1 keV . 
1051	The stream of particles varies in temperature and speed with the passage of time . 
1052	These particles are able to escape the sun 's gravity , in part because of the high temperature of the corona , David H.
