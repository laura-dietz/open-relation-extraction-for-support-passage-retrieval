1	Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity , either directly using photovoltaics ( PV) , or indirectly using concentrated solar power ( CSP) . 
2	Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam . 
3	Photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the photoelectric effect .

10	Department of Energy 19 April 2011 Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s . 
11	The 354 MW SEGS CSP installation is the largest solar power plant in the world , located in the Mojave Desert of California . 
12	Other large CSP plants include the Solnova Solar Power Station ( 150 MW) and the Andasol solar power station ( 150 MW) , both in Spain .

19	Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity . 
20	Sunlight can be converted directly into electricity using photovoltaics ( PV) , or indirectly with concentrated solar power ( CSP) , which normally focuses the sun 's energy to boil water which is then used to provide power . 
21	Other technologies also exist , such as Stirling engine dishes which use a Stirling cycle engine to power a generator . 
22	Photovoltaics were initially used to power small and medium-sized applications , from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to off-grid homes powered by a photovoltaic array . 
23	Solar thermal energy Concentrated solar power Concentrating Solar Power ( CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam . 
24	The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant . 
25	A wide range of concentrating technologies exists ; the most developed are the parabolic trough , the concentrating linear fresnel reflector , the Stirling dish and the solar power tower . 
26	Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light . 
27	In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight , and is then used for power generation or energy storage . 
28	Martin and Goswami ( 2005 ) , p . 
29	45 A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector 's focal line . 
30	The receiver is a tube positioned right above the middle of the parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid . 
31	The reflector is made to follow the Sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis . 
32	Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology .

40	2 July 2008 Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid . 
41	This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors , and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space , allowing more of the available sunlight to be used . 
42	Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants .

93	Solar cell produce direct current (DC ) power , which fluctuates with the intensity of the irradiated light . 
94	This usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC ) , which requires the use of the inverters . 
95	Multiple solar cells are connected inside the modules . 
96	Modules are wired together to form arrays , then tied to inverter , which produces power with the desired voltage , and frequency/phase ( when its AC ) .

180	to $ 2.43/watt 
181	over the course of 2011 , and a decline to prices below $ 2.00/watt

183	?page=1 The End of the Nuclear Renaissance John Quiggin 3 January 2012 National Interest For large-scale installations , prices below $ 1.00/watt 
184	are now common . 
185	In some locations , PV has reached grid parity , the cost at which it is competitive with coal or gas-fired generation . 
186	More generally , it is now evident that , given a carbon price of $ 50/ton , which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/k Wh , solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations . 
187	The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations , totalling about 23 GW in 2011 . 
188	Although some consolidation is likely in 2012 , as firms try to restore profitability , strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade . 
189	Already , by one estimate , total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation .

251	4 July 2008 Pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when surplus electricity is available , from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one . 
252	The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water : the pump becomes a turbine , and the motor a hydroelectric power generator .

257	31 July 2008 Artificial photosynthesis involves the use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds , by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol . 
258	Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture , quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions .

266	thumbrightConcentrating photovoltaics in Catalonia_ Spain Concentrated photovoltaics ( CPV ) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electrical power production . 
267	Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used , and these are often mounted on a solar tracker in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the Sun moves across the sky . 
268	MSU-CSET Participation Archive with notation in the Murray Ledger &amp; Times Luminescent solar concentrator ( when combined with a PV-solar cell ) can also be regarded as a CPV system . 
269	Luminescent solar concentrators are useful as they can improve performance of PV-solar panels drastically .

278	5 November 2008 19 April 2011 Thermoelectric , or " thermovoltaic " devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current . 
279	First proposed as a method to store solar energy by solar pioneer Mouchout in the 1800s , Perlin and Butti ( 1981 ) , p . 
280	73 thermoelectrics reemerged in the Soviet Union during the 1930s . 
281	Under the direction of Soviet scientist Abram Ioffe a concentrating system was used to thermoelectrically generate power for a 1&nbsp; hp engine . 
282	Halacy ( 1973 ) , p . 
283	76 Thermogenerators were later used in the US space program as an energy conversion technology for powering deep space missions such as Cassini , Galileo and Viking . 
284	Research in this area is focused on raising the efficiency of these devices from 7–8 % to 15–20 % .

286	366–368 Space-based solar power is a theoretical design for the collection of solar power in space , for use on Earth . 
287	SBSP differs from the usual method of solar power collection in that the solar panels used to collect the energy would reside on a satellite in orbit , often referred to as a solar power satellite ( SPS) , rather than on Earth 's surface . 
288	In space , collection of the Sun 's energy is unaffected by the day/night cycle , weather , seasons , or the filtering effect of Earth 's atmospheric gases . 
289	Average solar energy per unit area outside Earth 's atmosphere is on the order of ten times that available on Earth 's surface .
