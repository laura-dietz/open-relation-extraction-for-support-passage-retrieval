0	thumb330pxUK installed wind power capacity 1990–2011 ( operational ) At the beginning of 2012 , the installed capacity of wind power in the United Kingdom was over 5.9&nbsp; 
1	gigawatt which ranked the UK as the world’s eighth largest producer of wind power . 
2	Wind power is expected to continue growing in the UK for the foreseeable future , RenewableUK estimates that more than 2&nbsp;GW of capacity will be deployed per year for the next five years . 
3	Within the UK, wind power is the second largest source of renewable energy after biomass . 
4	2011 saw a pause in the progress of the UK wind industry with only 723&nbsp;MW of new wind power capacity brought online during 2011 , a 40 % decrease on 2010 . 
5	Only one offshore wind farm , phase 1 of the Walney Wind Farm , was completed in 2010 with a capacity of 183&nbsp;MW. 
6	This compares with a total 653&nbsp;MW built offshore in 2010 . 
7	Onshore installations were very similar to the previous year with 540&nbsp;MW completed . 
8	The largest coming on stream being the 120&nbsp;MW Arecleoch Wind Farm in South Ayrshire .A 
9	highlight of 2011 was on 28 December when wind power set a record contribution to the UK 's demand for electricity of 12.2 
10	% . 
11	2012 is expected to be a significant year for the offshore wind industry with potentially 5 farms becoming operational with over 1.3&nbsp;GW 
12	of generating capability . 
13	A 2004 study by the Royal Academy of Engineering found that wind power cost 5.4 
14	pence per kWh for onshore installations and 7.2 
15	pence per kWh for offshore , compared to 2.2p/k 
16	Wh for gas and 2.3p/k 
17	Wh for nuclear . 
18	By 2011 onshore wind costs at 8.3/k 
19	Wh had fallen below new nuclear at 9.6p/k 
20	Wh , though it had been recognised that offshore wind costs at 16.9p/k 
21	Wh were significantly higher than early estimates mainly due to higher build and finance costs , according to a study by the engineering consultancy Mott MacDonald .

44	BBC News Poverty fears over wind power 4 September 2008 As of January 2012 , there were 321 operational wind farms in the UK, with 3,506 turbines and 5,953&nbsp;MW of installed capacity . 
45	A further 3,519&nbsp;MW worth of schemes are currently under construction , while another 5,804&nbsp;MW have planning consent and some 9,849&nbsp;MW are in planning awaiting approval . 
46	In 2007 the UK Government agreed to an overall European Union target of generating 20 % of EU’s energy supply from renewable sources by 2020 . 
47	Each EU member state was given its own allocated target ; for the UK it is 15 % . 
48	This was formalised in January 2009 with the passage of the EU Renewables Directive . 
49	As renewable heat and fuel production in the UK are at extremely low bases , RenewableUK estimates that this will require 35–40 % of the UK’s electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date , to be met largely by 33–35 GW of installed wind capacity . 
50	In December 2007 , the Government announced plans for an expansion of wind energy in the UK, by conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment of up to 25 GW worth of wind farm offshore sites in preparation for a new round of development . 
51	These proposed sites are in addition to the 8&nbsp;GW worth of sites already awarded in the 2 earlier rounds of site allocations , Round 1 in 2001 and Round 2 in 2003 . 
52	Taken together it is estimated that this would result in the construction of over 7,000 offshore wind turbines .

86	Two Terawatts average power output : the UK offshore wind resource 2010-08-02 The first developments in UK offshore wind power came about through the now discontinued Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation ( NFFO ) , leading to two wind farms , Blyth Offshore and Gunfleet sands . 
87	The NFFO was introduced as part of the Electricity Act 1989 and obliged UK electricity supply companies to secure specified amounts of electricity from non-fossil sources , which provided the initial spur for the commercial development of renewable energy in the UK. 
88	The UK will require 7,500 offshore turbines by 2020 to meet EU targets .

91	Britain will need 12,500 wind farms to satisfy EU targets The Independent Michael McCarthy 2008-01-24 2008-10-07 London In 1998 the British Wind Energy Association ( now RenewableUK ) began discussions with the government to draw up formal procedures for negotiating with the Crown Estate , the owner of almost all the UK coastline out to distance of 12 nmi km 1 , to build offshore wind farms . 
92	The result was a set of guidelines published in 1999 , to build "development " farms designed to give developers a chance to gain technical and environmental experience . 
93	The projects were limited to 10 square kilometers in size and with a maximum of 30 turbines . 
94	Locations were chosen by potential developers and a large number of applications were submitted . 
95	Seventeen of the applications were granted permission to proceed in April 2001 , in what has become known as Round 1 of UK offshore wind development . 
96	The first of the Round 1 projects was North Hoyle Wind Farm , completed in December 2003 . 
97	Ten more have since been completed , the most recent being Ormonde in August 2011 . 
98	They provide a total power generating capacity of 1.1 
99	GW. 
100	The final project , Teeside , has planning consent and is awaiting construction . 
101	Five sites were withdrawn , including the Shell Flat site off the coast of Lancashire . 
102	Lessons learnt from Round 1 , particularly the difficulty in getting planning consent for offshore wind farms , together with the increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions , prompted the Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) to develop a strategic framework for the offshore wind industry . 
103	This identified three restricted areas for larger scale development , Liverpool Bay , the Thames Estuary and the area beyond The Wash , called the Greater Wash , in the North Sea . 
104	Development was prevented in an exclusion zone between 8 and 13&nbsp;km offshore to reduce visual impact and avoid shallow feeding grounds for sea birds . 
105	The new areas were tendered to prospective developers in a competitive bid process known as Round 2. 
106	The results were announced in December 2003 with 15 projects awarded with a combined power generating capacity of 7.2&nbsp;GW. 
107	By far the largest of these is the 1.2&nbsp;GW 
108	Triton Knoll . 
109	As before a full Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) would be needed along with an application for planning consent . 
110	The first of the Round 2 projects was Gunfleet Sands II , completed in April 2010 and followed by Thanet in September . 
111	Five other sites are currently under construction . 
112	In May 2010 the Crown Estate gave approval for seven Round 1 and 2 sites to be extended creating an additional 2&nbsp;GW of offshore wind capacity . 
113	Each wind farm extension will require a complete new planning application including an Environmental Impact Assessment and full consultation . 
114	The sites are : Following on from the Offshore wind SEA announced by the Government in December 2007 , the Crown Estate launched a third round of site allocations in June 2008 . 
115	Round 3 is envisaged on a much bigger scale than either of its predecessors – combined , Rounds 1 and 2 allocated 8 GW of sites , while Round 3 alone could identify up to 25 GW. 
116	The Crown Estate proposed 9 offshore zones , within which a number of individual wind farms would be situated . 
117	It ran a competitive tender process to award leases to consortia of potential developers . 
118	The bidding closed in March 2009 with over 40 applications from companies and consortia and multiple tenders for each zone . 
119	On 8 January 2010 the successful bidders were announced . 
120	Following the allocation of zones , individual planning applications still have to be sought by developers . 
121	These are unlikely to be completed before 2012 and as such the first Round 3 projects are not expected to begin generating electricity before 2015 . 
122	During the bidding process , there was considerable speculation over which companies had bid for the zones . 
123	The Crown Estate did not make the list public and most of the consortia also remained silent . 
124	The successful bidders for each zone were eventually announced as follows : In addition to the 25 GW scoped under the Round 3 SEA , the Scottish Government and the Crown Estate also called for bids on potential sites within Scottish territorial waters . 
125	These were originally considered as too deep to provide viable sites , but 17 companies submitted tenders and the Crown Estate initially signed exclusivity agreements with 9 companies for 6 GW worth of sites . 
126	Following publication of the Scottish Government 's sectoral marine plan for offshore wind energy in Scottish territorial waters in March 2010 , six sites were given approval subject to securing detailed consent . 
127	Subsequently 5 sites have been granted agreements for lease .

129	The first commercial wind farm was built in 1991 at Delabole in Cornwall , it consisted of 10 turbines each with a capacity to generate a maximum of 400&nbsp;kW. 
130	Following this , the early 1990s saw a small but steady growth with half a dozen farms becoming operational each year , the larger wind farms tended to be built on the hills of Wales , examples being Rhyd-y-Groes , Llandinam , Bryn Titli and Carno . 
131	Smaller farms were also appearing on the hills and moors of Northern Ireland and England . 
132	The end of 1995 saw the first commercial wind farm in Scotland go into operation at Hagshaw Hill . 
133	The late 1990s saw sustained growth as the industry matured . 
134	In 2000 the first turbines capable of generating more than 1MW were installed and the pace of growth started to accelerate as the larger power companies like Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern became increasingly involved in order to meet legal reguirements to generate a certain amount of electricity using renewable means ( see Renewables Obligations below ) . 
135	Wind turbine development continued rapidly and by the mid 2000s 2MW+ turbines were the norm . 
136	Growth continued with bigger farms and larger , more efficient turbines sitting on taller and taller masts . 
137	Scotland 's sparsely populated , hilly and windy countryside became a popular area for developers and the UKs first 100MW+ farm went operational in 2006 at Hadyard Hill in South Ayrshire . 
138	2006 also saw the first use of the 3MW turbine . 
139	In 2008 the largest onshore wind farm in England was completed on Scout Moor and the repowering of the Slieve Rushen wind farm created the largest farm in Northern Ireland . 
140	In 2009 the largest wind farm in the UK went live at Whitelee on Eaglesham Moor in Scotland . 
141	This is a 322MW wind farm consisting of 140 turbines . 
142	Approval has been granted to build several more 100MW+ wind farms on hills in Scotland and will feature 3.6MW 
143	turbines . 
144	As of January 2012 there were 307 operational onshore wind farms in the UK with a total of 4428&nbsp;MW of nameplate capacity . 
145	A further 1464&nbsp;MW of capacity is being constructed , while another 3.9&nbsp;GW 
146	of schemes have planning consent and 7.6&nbsp;GW 
147	are in the planning stage . 
148	In 2009 UK onshore wind farms generated 7,564&nbsp;GW·h of electricity , this represents a 2 % contribution to the total UK electricity generation ( 378.5&nbsp;TW·h 
149	) .

162	Embedded and Renewable Generation 2009 Seven Year Statement National Grid 2009 13 February 2011 Gaining planning permission for onshore wind farms continues to prove difficult , with many schemes stalled in the planning system , and a high rate of refusal . 
163	The RenewableUK ( formerly BWEA ) figures show that there are approximately 7,000&nbsp;MW worth of onshore schemes waiting for planning permission . 
164	On average a wind farm planning application takes 2 years to be considered by a local authority , with an approval rate of 40 % . 
165	This compares extremely unfavourably with other types of major applications , such as housing , retail outlets and roads , 70 % of which are decided within the 13-16 week statutory deadline ; for wind farms the rate is just 6 % .Approximately 
166	half of all wind farm planning applications , over 4 GW worth of schemes , have objections from airports and traffic control on account of their impact on radar . 
167	In 2008 NATS en Route , the BWEA , the Ministry of Defence and other Government departments signed a Memorandum of Understanding seeking to establish a mechanism for resolving objections and funding for more technical research . 
168	Renewables Obligation Through the Renewables Obligation , British electricity suppliers are now required by law to provide a proportion of their sales from renewable sources such as wind power or pay a penalty fee . 
169	The supplier then receives a Renewables Obligation Certificate ( ROC ) for each MWh of electricity they have purchased . 
170	The Energy Act 2008 introduced banded ROCs for different technologies from April 2009 . 
171	Onshore wind receives 1 ROC per MWh , however following the Renewables Obligation Banding Review in 2009 offshore wind now receives 2 ROCs to reflect its higher costs of generation .

174	Wind energy receives approximately 40 % of the total revenue generated by the RO. 
175	The ROCs are the principal form of support for UK wind power , providing over half of the revenue from wind generation . 
176	Small wind systems under 50&nbsp;k W previously received 2 ROCs , but are now eligible for support under the Feed In Tariff .

179	Wind -generated power is a variable resource , and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds , air density , and turbine characteristics (among other factors ) . 
180	If wind speed is too low ( less than about 2.5&nbsp;m/s 
181	) then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity , and if it is too high ( more than about 25&nbsp;m/s ) the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage . 
182	If this happens during a winter cold snap , when winds are calm over large regions and electrical demand reaches its highest levels of the year , other power sources must have the capacity of meeting that entire demand .

185	London Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009 , generally agree that variability of the wind does not make the grid unmanageable ; and the additional costs , which are modest , can be quantified . 
186	In the UK, demand for electricity is higher in winter than in summer , and so are wind speeds .

197	As the distance between sites increases , the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites , decreases . 
198	This has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by Graham Sinden from Oxford University : Diesendorf , Mark ( 2007 ) . 
199	Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy , p . 
200	119 . 
201	[Graham Sinden ] analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom . 
202	He found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 
203	at 200 km to 0.25 
204	at 600 km separation ( a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0. 
205	) There were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the United Kingdom , and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the United Kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year . 
206	A 2011 report authored by wind farm critic Stuart Young and supported by the John Muir Trust , said that Scotland’s wind farms are only delivering a fraction of the power their builders claim . 
207	The report looked at wind farm output over a 26 month period between November 2008 to December 2010 using data from the industry ’s Balancing Mechanism Reporting System . 
208	The report concluded that wind power " cannot be relied upon to provide significant levels of power " and " that there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the use of the energy source in future " .

215	13 August 2011 There was an "angry response " to the report from the energy industry , and the body representing Scotland’s renewable energy refused to recognise the figures . 
216	Jenny Hogan , Director of Policy for Scottish Renewables , said : " We have no confidence in these unofficial figures " , and added : " It could be argued the Trust is acting irresponsibly given their expertise lies in protecting our wild lands and yet they seem to be going to great lengths to undermine renewable energy which is widely recognised as one of the biggest solutions to tackling climate change " .

221	Sparks fly over John Muir Trust wind farm report Judy Armstrong April 11 , 2011 The Great Outdoors An independent study investigated the JMT report by cross-referencing Renewable Obligation Certificates over the same study period and concluded that wind farms performed much better due to data problems with the BMReports website upon which the JMT Report was based . 
222	A Scottish government spokesman has said electricity generated by renewables accounted for 27 % of Scotland 's electricity use . 
223	On the evening of the 5th into the 6th of April , 2011 , the wind in Scotland was high , it was raining heavily , which also created more hydroelectricity than normal . 
224	The grid became overloaded and a transmission fault in the system "meant the surplus energy could not be transferred to England and so generation had to be cut " . 
225	Wind farms operators "were paid £900,000 by the National Grid to disconnect their turbines for one night because the electricity was not needed " .

233	Scots windfarms paid cash to stop producing energy 1 May 2011 BBC News There is some dispute over the necessary amount of reserve or backup required to support the large-scale use of wind energy due to the variable nature of its supply . 
234	In a 2008 submission to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee , E.ON 
235	UK argued that it is necessary to have up to 80–90 % backup .

244	UK June 2008 13 February 2011 National Grid which has responsibility for balancing the grid reported in June 2009 that the electricity distribution grid could cope with on-off wind energy without spending a lot on backup , but only by rationing electricity at peak times using a so-called " smart grid " , developing increased energy storage technology and increasing interconnection with the rest of Europe .

249	BBC News UK expands wind power potential 2009-06-24 Roger Harrabin In June 2011 several energy companies including Centrica told the government that 17 gas-fired plants costing £10 billion would be needed by 2020 to act as back-up generation for wind . 
250	However as they would be standing idle for much of the time they would require " capacity payments " to make the investment economic , on top of the subsidies already paid for wind .
