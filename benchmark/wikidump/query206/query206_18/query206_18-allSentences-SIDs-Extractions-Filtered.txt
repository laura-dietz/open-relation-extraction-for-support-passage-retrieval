UK June 2008 13 February 2011 National Grid which has responsibility for balancing the grid reported in June 2009 that the electricity distribution grid could cope with on-off wind energy without spending a lot on backup , but only by rationing electricity at peak times using a so-called " smart grid " , developing increased energy storage technology and increasing interconnection with the rest of Europe . 	244
