0	May 2011 Wind power in Australia is a proven and reliable technology that can be and is readily deployed . 
1	As of October 2010 , there were 52 wind farm in Australia , most of which had turbines of from 1.5 
2	to 3 megawatts ( MW) . 
3	The total operating wind generating capacity at this time was 1,880 MW, with annual production of almost 5,000 GWh providing close to two percent of Australia 's national electricity demand . 
4	However , despite having excellent conditions for wind power , Australia lags considerably behind leading nations both in terms of wind generation capacity and percentage of power production . 
5	South Australia had close to half of the nation 's wind power capacity , International Energy Agency ( 2009 ) .

7	79-82 . 
8	accounting for almost twenty percent of that state 's electricity needs of as October 2010 . 
9	Victoria also had a substantial system , with about a quarter of the nation 's capacity , and projects under construction forecast to more than double that capacity by the end of 2013 . 
10	As of October 2010 , wind power accounted for approximately 5&nbsp; TWh out of a total of 251&nbsp; TWh of electricity used per year , Clean Energy Australia 2010 ( Report ) http ://www.cleanenergycouncil

27	This came from 52 operating wind farms with greater than 100&nbsp;k W capacity , consisting of a total of 1,052&nbsp;turbines . 
28	This figure represented approximately a 30 % increase in wind power generation each year over the previous decade , or a total increase of more than 1,000 % over that time . 
29	The total installed capacity at October 2010 was 1,880&nbsp; MW ( 1.88&nbsp;GW) 
30	, counting only projects over 100&nbsp;kW , with a further 1,043&nbsp;MW under construction . 
31	Australia 's total wind generation capacity of 1,880&nbsp;MW in 2010 was considerably lower in comparison to many other developed and developing nations , ranking 15th globally behind leaders such as China with 44,733&nbsp;MW, the US with 40,180&nbsp;MW, Germany with 27,215&nbsp;MW, Spain with 20,676&nbsp;MW, and India with 13,066&nbsp;MW.

58	The Garnaut Climate Change Review , the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the Mandatory Renewable energy Target announced by the Australian Government involve a reduction in Australian greenhouse gas emissions . 
59	Australia is the highest emitter of greenhouse gases per capita in the developed world and wind power is well placed to grow and deliver greenhouse gas emission cuts on a cost competitive basis . 
60	A typical 50-megawatt ( MW) wind farm in Australia can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 65,000 and 115,000&nbsp;tonnes a year . 
61	Based on the 2010 figures for electricity production of 5 TWh nationally , it is estimated that wind power saved Australia 5,100,000&nbsp;tonnes of CO 2 emissions in that year . 
62	In relative terms , that is calculated to be the equivalent of removing 1,133,000 cars from the nation 's roads . 
63	thumbrightThe information centre near the base of one of the towers at Wattle Point Wind Farm Australia has excellent wind resources by world standards . 
64	The southern coastline lies in the roaring forties and hundreds of sites have average wind speeds above 8 or even 9&nbsp;m/s at 50&nbsp;m above ground ( the hub height of a modern wind generator ) . 
65	The southwest of Western Australia , southern South Australia , western Victoria , northern Tasmania and elevated areas of New South Wales and Queensland have good wind resources . 
66	Several states engaged in systematic wind speed monitoring in the 1980s and 1990s , the results of which are publicly available .

79	2007-08-30 Australian wind farms produce on average capacity factor of 30–35 % , making wind an attractive option . 
80	However , the modelling of how wind generating capacity correlates with electricity demand in terms of daily , seasonal and year-to-year patterns of both , has yet to be conducted . 
81	As of October 2010 , there were 52 wind farms of greater than 100&nbsp;k W capacity operating in Australia . 
82	The Waubra Wind Farm near Ballarat_ Victoria , completed in 2009 , was the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere , , retrieved 19 November 2010 consisting of 128&nbsp;turbines spread over 173&nbsp;km 2 and rated at 192&nbsp;MW, however in terms of generating capacity Lake Bonney Wind Farm near Millicent _ South Australia was the largest with 239.5&nbsp;MW, 
83	despite only having 99&nbsp;turbines . 
84	These figures were set to be surpassed by the Macarthur Wind Farm at Macarthur_ Victoria , scheduled to open in 2013 with a capacity of 420&nbsp;MW. 
85	By generating capacity , the ten largest wind farms in Australia were : Australia 's first commercial wind farm , Salmon Beach Wind Farm near Esperance in Western Australia operated for 15 years from 1987 , but was decommissioned due to urban encroachment ; it has been replaced by Ten Mile Lagoon Wind Farm and Nine Mile Beach Wind Farm . 
86	In August 2009 , The Age newspaper reported that the first of three new large-scale wind farming projects to offset Australia 's power-hungry desalination plants would be going ahead .

96	The following figures were based on capacity as of October 2010 , and included only projects larger than 100&nbsp;kW. 
97	In world terms , South Australia 's market penetration of 19.4 
98	% placed it on par the world 's leading nation , Denmark , who provided approximately 19 % of their total electricity from wind . 
99	Wind power#Economics Making comparisons between wind and other sources of energy can be difficult because of the cost profiles associated with wind developments . 
100	The vast majority of the costs associated with wind developments are upfront capital costs . 
101	The operating costs are relatively low , with each additional unit of wind power costing very little to produce . 
102	By comparison , conventional gas and coal developments have large capital costs , as well as significant operating costs . 
103	The difference in cost profiles creates difficulties when trying to compare the cost of alternative energy sources . 
104	The Australia Institute ( 2006 ) . 
105	Discussion Paper Number 91 , October , ISSN 1322-5421 Despite these complexities , most of the data indicate that wind energy is one of the most cost efficient sources of renewable energy and that when the costs associated with pollution are factored in it is competitive with coal - and gas-fired power stations . 
106	Environmental impact of wind power rightthumbWind poweris one of the most environmentally friendly sources of renewable energy Australia is the fifth highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases with 25.8 
107	tonne CO 2 -e per person annually , ranking first of the industrialized countries , and ranks sixteenth of all countries in total country emissions with 495 Mt CO 2 -e per annum . 
108	It is one of the major exporters of coal , the burning of which releases CO 2 into the atmosphere . 
109	It is also one of the countries most at risk from climate change according to the Stern report . 
110	This is partially because of the size of its agriculture sector and long coastline . 
111	A wind farm , when installed on agricultural land , has one of the lowest environmental impacts of all energy sources : Landscape and heritage issues may be a significant issue for certain wind farms ,however these are minimal when compared with the Environmental effects of coal . 
112	However , when appropriate planning procedures are followed , the heritage and landscape risks should be minimal . 
113	Some people may still object to wind farms , perhaps on the grounds of aesthetics , but their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community . 
114	Overseas experience has shown that community consultation and direct involvement of the general public in wind farm projects has helped to increase community approval . 
115	Some wind farms become tourist attractions . 
116	From 2001 to early 2006 , the main driving force for the establishment of wind farms in Australia was the Government 's Mandatory Renewable Energy Target ( MRET ) .

119	Diesendorf , Mark ( 2007 ) . 
120	Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy , UNSW Press , p . 
121	107 . 
122	However , by mid-2006 , sufficient renewable energy had been installed or was under construction to meet the small MRET target for 2010 . 
123	Also , in 2006 , several Federal Government Ministers spoke out against a number of wind farm proposals . 
124	Dr Mark Diesendorf has suggested that the Australian Government has tried to stop the development of wind power , the lowest-cost , new , renewable electricity source , until such time as coal-fired power stations with CO 2 capture and sequestration and possibly nuclear power stations are available . 
125	However , " clean coal " technologies may not be commercially available for at least 20 years . 
126	Furthermore , to bring down the high cost of nuclear power to a level where it could compete with wind power would require a new generation of nuclear power stations that is still on the drawing board , which could take at least 15 years . 
127	In November 2007 the Rudd ( Labor ) government was elected in Australia , replacing the Howard ( Liberal/National Coalition ) government . 
128	The new government ratified Australia 's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol , promised a target of 20 % renewable power by 2020 and to do more to reduce Australia 's greenhouse gas emissions . 
129	As a result , several new wind power projects have been proposed in anticipation of an expanded MRET. 
130	In July 2011 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 4 Corners program explored health concerns connected with Australian wind farms in its " " report . 
131	Epuron specialises in electricity generation using renewable energy . 
132	Its focus is on windpower development in NSW , with major projects developed or proposed by Epuron including : Meridian Energy is the largest electricity generator in New Zealand and has in recent years expanded into Australia . 
133	It uses only renewable energy generation sources , and its Australian operations are currently focused on windpower . 
134	Projects completed or currently being developed include : Pacific Hydro is an Australian company that specialises in electricity generation using renewable energy . 
135	Its focus is on hydroelectricity and windpower . 
136	Wind power stations owned by Pacific Hydro include : Roaring 40s is based in Tasmania and has two wind farms operating in Australia : Woolnorth Wind Farm in Tasmania and Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm in South Australia . 
137	It is currently ( as of December 2009 ) constructing the 117MW Waterloo Wind Farm in the Mid North of South Australia .

145	Wind Prospect undertakes all aspects of wind energy development , including design , construction , operation and commercial services , with offices in the UK, Ireland , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and China . 
146	With over 18 years of successful development within the industry , the Wind Prospect Group has been involved in over 2,500MW of approved wind farms , including onshore and offshore projects , in terms of development , construction , operations and commercial services , and has a further 4000MW in the early phase of development . 
147	The company ’s civil , electrical and mechanical engineers have been involved in the commissioning of over 50 wind farms around the world . 
148	Wind Prospect ’s development offices in Australia are in Adelaide , Newcastle , Brisbane and Melbourne . 
149	Wind Prospect Pty Ltd ( WPPL) is the most successful developer in Australia , having achieved planning approval for 10 wind farms totalling over 860 MW, of which 565MW is operating or under construction . 
150	Two recent successes in South Australia are the North Brown Hill Wind Farm ( 132.3MW) 
151	and The Bluff Range Wind Farm ( 52.1MW) 
152	, both approximately 270&nbsp;km north east of Adelaide , which are Wind Prospect ’s sixth and seventh wind farm developments respectively to progress to construction in South Australia . 
153	More projects in this region have received planning approval and are expected to proceed to construction . 
154	Windlab Systems is an Australian company with operations in the USA , Canada and South Africa . 
155	It was established in 2003 as a CSIRO spin-off . 
156	The company uses self developed technologies , Windscape which is based on CSIRO’s atmospheric modelling technology and advanced wind monitoring tools , to undertake a program of site identification , site validation and wind farm development . 
157	Approximately 1500 megawatts of projects in Australia have used Windlab intellectual property for site identification purposes . 
158	The company co-developed the Oakland 's Hill ( 67MW) wind farm and the Collgar Wind Farm ( 206MW) . 
159	Windlab has since become a full wind farm developer and takes projects to the point of construction .
