0	Sociology April 2008 April 2008 March 2009 Pride is an inwardly directed emotion that carries two common meanings . 
1	With a negative connotation , pride refers to an inflated sense of one 's personal status or accomplishments , often used synonym with hubris . 
2	With a positive connotation , pride refers to a satisfied sense of attachment toward one 's own or another 's choices and actions , or toward a whole group of people , and is a product of praise , independent self-reflection , or a fulfilled feeling of belonging . 
3	Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions ( e .g. 
4	, that pride is distinct from happiness and joy ) through language-based interaction with others .

18	PMID 19803585 In contrast pride could also be defined as a disagreement with the truth . 
19	One definition of pride in the first sense comes from St . 
20	Augustine : " the love of one 's own excellence " . 
21	" Est autem superbia amor proprie excellentie , et fuit initium peccati superbia . 
22	" In this sense , the opposite of pride is either humility or guilt ; the latter in particular being a sense of one 's own failure in contrast to Augustine 's notion of excellence . 
23	Pride is sometimes viewed as excessive or as a vice , sometimes as proper or as a virtue . 
24	While some philosophers such as Aristotle ( and George Bernard Shaw ) consider pride a profound virtue , most world religion consider it a sin , such as the Old Testament of the Bible used by Christians and Jews , in Proverbs 11:2. 
25	According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary , proud comes from late Old English prut , probably from Old French prud "brave , valiant " ( 11th century ) ( which became preux in French ) , from Late Latin term prodis "useful" , which is compared with the Latin prodesse "be of use " . 
26	, accessed 9 Nov. 
27	2008 The sense of "having a high opinion of oneself" , not in French , may reflect the Anglo-Saxons ' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves "proud" , like the French knights preux . 
28	June 2008 When viewed as a virtue , pride in one 's appearance and abilities is known as virtuous pride , greatness of soul or magnanimity , but when viewed as a vice it is often termed vanity or vainglory . 
29	Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one 's nation ( national pride ) and ethnicity (ethnic pride ) . 
30	Aristotle identified pride ( megalopsuchia , variously translated as proper pride , greatness of soul and magnanimity ) as the crown of the virtues , distinguishing it from vanity , temperance , and humility , thus : He concludes then that By contrast , Aristotle defined hubris as follows : Thus , although many religions may not recognize the difference , for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is altogether an entirely different thing from pride . 
31	In psychological terms , Pride is " a pleasant , sometimes exhilarating , emotion that results from a positive self-evaluation " .

61	Facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin , smiles , or arms on hips to demonstrate victory . 
62	Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride , even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so . 
63	Indeed , some studies shows that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person 's high social status in a group . 
64	Behaviorally , pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body . 
65	This postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others . 
66	Tracy &amp; Matsumoto , 2008 . 
67	A common understanding of pride is that it results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals ; for example , Weiner et al . 
68	have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone . 
69	Moreover , Oveis et al . 
70	conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others , as well as differentiation from weak others . 
71	Seen in this light , pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion , as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict .

79	Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment . 
80	It is related to "more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud " ( Weiner , 1985 ) . 
81	Pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion . 
82	Along with hope , it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment , as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events . 
83	It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended ( Fredrickson , 2001 ) . 
84	According to Bagozzi et al . 
85	, pride can have the positive benefits of enhancing creativity , productivity , and altruism . 
86	For instance , it has been found that in terms of school achievement , pride is associated with a higher GPA in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments , whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods , high pride was associated with a lower GPA.

95	In the field of economic psychology , Pride is conceptualized in a spectrum ranging from ‘proper pride’ , associated with genuine achievements , and ‘false pride , ’ which can be maladaptive or even pathological . 
96	Lea et al . 
97	have examined the role of pride various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another , but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them .

106	Dr. 
107	Terry D. 
108	Cooper ( 2003 ) conceptualizes excessive pride , along with low self-esteem , as an important paradigm in describing the human condition . 
109	He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary , the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women , the humanistic psychology position that pride does not adequately account for anyone 's experience , and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges , it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self .

116	He refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem : The "idealized self , " the "tyranny of the should , " the "pride system " and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt .

119	Group narcissism Hubris itself is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility ( Tangney , 1999 ) . 
120	As one might expect , Hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem . 
121	Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships , which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions without any clear positive or adaptive functions ( Rhodwalt , et al . 
122	).Several 
123	studies by UC Davis psychologist Cynthia Picket , have shown that groups that boast , gloat or denigrate others tend to have low social status or be vulnerable to threats from other groups .

125	In contrast , those groups that expressed pride by humbly focusing on members ' efforts and hard work tended to have high social standing in both the public and personal eyes .

127	Nationalism April 2008 In Germany , "national pride " ( " Nationalstolz" ) is often associated with the former Nazi regime . 
128	Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans . 
129	There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German patriotism . 
130	The World Cup in 2006 , held in Germany , saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years . 
131	Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows , as the team progressed through the tournament , so too did the level of support across the nation .

142	By the time the semi-final against Italy came around , the level of national pride and unity was at its highest throughout the tournament , and the hosting of the World Cup is seen to have been a great success for Germany as a nation . 
143	After the World Cup , however , the subject of patriotism became again as difficult as it had been before . 
144	May 2010 Asian pride Asian pride in modern slang refers mostly to those of East Asian descent , though it can include anyone of Asian descent . 
145	Asian pride was originally fragmented , as Asian nations have had long conflicts with each other , examples are the old Japanese and Chinese religious beliefs of their individual superiority . 
146	Asian pride emerged prominently during European colonialism .

151	At one time , Europeans controlled 85 % of the world 's land through colonialism , resulting in anti-Western feelings among Asian nations . 
152	Today , some Asians still look upon European involvement in their affairs with suspicion . 
153	In contrast , Asian empire are prominent and are proudly remembered by adherents to Asian Pride . 
154	An example is the Mongol Empire , which was the largest contiguous empire in history , occupying most of Asia and reaching as far as Europe . 
155	Another empire is Imperial Japan , the symbols of which are widespread in modern culture , especially the Rising Sun Flag , one of the main symbols of Japanese pride . 
156	Black pride Black pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise awareness for a black racial identity . 
157	The slogan has been used by African Americans (especially of sub-Saharan African origin ) to denote a feeling of self-confidence , self-respect , celebrating one 's heritage , and being proud of one 's personal worth . 
158	Black pride as a national movement is closely linked with the developments of the American Civil Rights Movement , during which noted figures such as Martin Luther King _ Jr. 
159	, Malcolm X , A. 
160	Philip Randolph , Stokely Carmichael , and others protested the conditions of the United States ' segregated society , and lobbied for better treatment for people of the Black race . 
161	Roy Innis has sought to enhance and build on the black pride movement of the mid-1960s , he and a Congress of Racial Equality delegation toured seven African countries in 1971 . 
162	The concept of black power permeated into the work of popular musicians at the time . 
163	The Impressions 's " We 're a Winner " , written by their lead singer Curtis Mayfield , became a virtual anthem of the black power and black pride movements , as did James Brown 's " Say It Loud - I 'm Black and I 'm Proud " , Collin Carlone 's " Life As a ' Boro Black Boy" , and , unwittingly , Martha &amp; the Vandellas ' " Dancing in the Street " . 
164	In addition to Black America , the Black Pride Movement was very prevalent in http ://video.aol.com/video-detail/black-pride-brazil/349833279 
165	“Afro-Brazil , especially throughout their poorer population . 
166	A local and global recognition of this movement has been demonstrated throughout Brazilian funk .

168	Ethnomusicologist George Yúdice’s states that youth were engaging black culture mediated by a U.S.

213	The word pride is used in this case an antonym for shame . 
214	Pride in this sense is an affirmation of ones self and the community as a whole . 
215	The modern "pride " movement began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s . 
216	There are many organisations around the world which organise , manage and host ' Pride ' Events . 
217	In the UK, Pride events have been few and far between - traditionally in and , but they are on the increase , with Pride events such as Northern Pride gaining massive support and largely increasing in attendance each year . 
218	In countries such as the United States , pride festivals can be yearly events such as the one held in each october . 
219	Vanity In conventional parlance , vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one 's personal appearance , attractiveness and dress and is thus not the same as pride . 
220	However , it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one 's own abilities or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in so far be compared to pride . 
221	The term Vanity originates from the Latin word vanitas meaning emptiness , untruthfulness , futility , foolishness and empty pride . 
222	; Here empty pride means a fake pride , in the sense of vainglory , unjustified by one 's own achievements and actions , but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics . 
223	In many religions , vanity is considered a form of self - idolatry , in which one rejects God for the sake of one 's own image , and thereby becomes divorced from the grace of God . 
224	The stories of Lucifer and Narcissus ( who gave us the term narcissism ) , and others , attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity . 
225	In Western art , vanity was often symbolized by a peacock , and in Biblical terms , by the Whore of Babylon . 
226	In secular allegory , vanity was considered one of the minor vices . 
227	During the Renaissance , vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman , sometimes seated or reclining on a couch . 
228	She attends to her hair with comb and mirror . 
229	The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto . 
230	Other symbols of vanity include jewels , gold coins , a purse , and often by the figure of death himself . 
231	Often we find an inscription on a scroll that reads Omnia Vanitas ( " All is Vanity " ) , a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes . 
232	James Hall , Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art ( New York : Harper &amp; Row , 1974 ) , 318 . 
233	Although that phrase , itself depicted in a type of still life , vanitas , originally referred not to obsession with one 's appearance , but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man 's efforts in this world , the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture . 
234	" The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her , " writes Edwin Mullins , "while offering us full permission to drool over her . 
235	She admires herself in the glass , while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her .

237	, 1985 ) , 62-3 . 
238	The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus . 
239	thumb" All Is Vanity " byC. 
240	Allan Gilbert _ evoking the invetiable decay of life and beauty toward death . 
241	In his table of the Seven Deadly Sins , Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil . 
242	Behind her is an open jewelry box . 
243	A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier , which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum , is An Allegory of Justice and Vanity . 
244	A young woman holds a balance , symbolizing justice ; she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her . 
245	Vermeer 's famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity , as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes . 
246	All is Vanity , by Charles Allan Gilbert ( 1873–1929 ) , carries on this theme . 
247	An optical illusion , the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull . 
248	Upon closer examination , it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror.Such 
249	artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty , as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death . 
250	The most common literary term for pride is hubris ( sometimes spelled hybris ; Greek : ὕβρις ) . 
251	In Ancient Greece , instances of pride were termed hubris because of the added connotation that pride was a crime against the gods and would result in fatal retribution . 
252	The word was also used to describe those who considered themselves more important than the gods themselves . 
253	Hubris against the gods is often attributed as a character flaw of the heroes in Greek tragedy , and the cause of the " nemesis " , or destruction , which befalls these characters . 
254	However , this represents only a small proportion of occurrences of hubris in Greek literature , and for the most part hubris refers to infractions by mortals against other mortals . 
255	Therefore , it is now generally agreed that the Greeks did not generally think of hubris as a religious matter , still less that it was normally punished by the gods . 
256	MacDowell ( 1976 ) p . 
257	22 . 
258	The ancient Greek concept of hubris extended to what would today be termed assault and battery . 
259	Achilles and his treatment of Hector 's corpse in Homer 's Iliad demonstrates hubris . 
260	June 2008 Similarly , Creon commits hubris in refusing to bury Polynices in Sophocles ' Antigone . 
261	Another example is in the tragedy Agamemnon , by Aeschylus . 
262	June 2008 Agamemnon initially rejects the hubris of walking on the fine purple tapestry , an act which is suggested by Clytemnestra , in hopes of bringing his ruin . 
263	This act may be seen as a desecration of a divinely woven tapestry , as a general flouting of the strictures imposed by the gods , or simply as an act of extreme pride and lack of humility before the gods , tempting them to retribution . 
264	One other example is that of Oedipus . 
265	June 2008 In Sophocles ' Oedipus the King , while on the road to Thebes , Oedipus meets King Laius of Thebes who is unknown to him as his biological father . 
266	Oedipus kills King Laius in a dispute over which of them has the right of way , thereby fulfilling the prophecy of the oracle Loxias that Oedipus is destined to murder his own father . 
267	Odysseus ' ten year journey home was the result of hubris : June 2008 after blinding the Cyclops , he mockingly declared his name to the monster as he escaped . 
268	This allowed the Cyclops to call upon his father Poseidon for help and curse him . 
269	Victor in Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein exudes hubris in order to become a great scientist , but is eventually regretting this previous desire . 
270	Faustus in Christopher Marlowe 's play Doctor Faustus exudes hubris , all the way until his final minutes of life . 
271	Hubris is extreme haughtiness or arrogance . 
272	Hubris often indicates being out of touch with reality and overestimating one 's own competence or capabilities , especially for people in positions of power . 
273	In his book , the British politician David Owen argues that President George W. 
274	Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair developed a Hubristic Syndrome while in power .
