0	September 2011 The Holy See ( Sancta Sedes , "holy chair" ) is the episcopal jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church , in which its Bishop is the Pope . 
1	It is the preeminent episcopal see of the Catholic Church , forming the central government of the Church . 
2	As such , diplomatically , the Holy See acts and speaks for the whole Catholic Church . 
3	It is also recognized by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity , headed by the Pope , with which diplomatic relations can be maintained .

5	(viewed on December 14 , 2011 ) , on the website of the British Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office . 
6	The Holy See 's sovereignty has been recognized explicitly in many international agreements and is particularly emphasized in article 2 of the Lateran Treaty of 11 February 1929 , in which " Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the Holy See in the international field as an inherent attribute of its nature , in conformity with its tradition , and the requirements of its mission in the world . 
7	" Although it is often referred to as " the Vatican " , the Holy See is not the same entity as the Vatican City State , which came into existence only in 1929 ; the Holy See , the episcopal see of Rome , dates back to early Christian times . 
8	Ambassadors are officially accredited not to the Vatican City State but to " the Holy See " , and papal representatives to states and international organizations are recognized as representing the Holy See , not the Vatican City State . 
9	Though all episcopal see may be considered "holy" , the expression " the Holy See " ( without further specification ) is normally used in international relations ( and in the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church ) , to refer to the See of Rome viewed as the central government of the Roman Catholic Church . 
10	The website of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office speaks of Vatican City as the " capital " of the Holy See , although it compares the legal personality of the Holy See to that of the Crown in Christian monarchies and declares that the Holy See and the state of Vatican City are two international identities . 
11	It also distinguishes between the employees of the Holy See ( 2,750 working in the Roman Curia with another 333 working in the Holy See 's diplomatic missions abroad ) and the 1,909 employees of the state . 
12	Retrieved 8 January 2011 The British Ambassador to the Holy See uses more precise language , saying that the Holy See "is not the same as the Vatican City State . 
13	… ( It ) is the universal government of the Catholic Church and operates from the Vatican City State . 
14	" (emphasis added ) This agrees exactly with the expression used by the website of the United States Department of State , in giving information on both the Holy See and the Vatican City State : it too says that the Holy See "operates from the Vatican City State " .

19	Roman Curia The Pope governs the Catholic Church through the Roman Curia . 
20	The Roman Curia consists of a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level , including the Secretariat of State , nine Congregations , three Tribunals , eleven Pontifical Councils , and seven Pontifical Commissions . 
21	The Secretariat of State , under the Cardinal Secretary of State , directs and coordinates the Curia . 
22	The incumbent , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , is the See 's equivalent of a prime minister . 
23	Archbishop Dominique Mamberti , Secretary of the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State , acts as the Holy See 's minister of foreign affairs . 
24	Bertone and Mamberti were named in their respective roles by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2006 . 
25	leftthumbVatican City The Secretariat of State is the only body of the Curia that is situated within Vatican City . 
26	The others are in buildings in different parts of Rome that have extraterritorial rights similar to those of embassies . 
27	Among the most active of the major Curial institutions are the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which oversees the Catholic Church 's doctrine ; the Congregation for Bishops , which coordinates the appointment of bishops worldwide ; the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples , which oversees all missionary activities ; and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace , which deals with international peace and social issues . 
28	Three tribunals exercise judicial power . 
29	The Roman Rota handles normal judicial appeals , the most numerous being those that concern alleged nullity of marriage .

45	The Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See coordinates the finances of the Holy See departments and supervises the administration of all offices , whatever be their degree of autonomy , that manage these finances . 
46	The most important of these is the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See . 
47	The Prefecture of the Papal Household is responsible for the organization of the papal household , audiences , and ceremonies ( apart from the strictly liturgical part ) . 
48	The Holy See does not dissolve upon a Pope 's death or resignation . 
49	It instead operates under a different set of laws sede vacante . 
50	During this interregnum , the heads of the dicasteries of the Roman Curia ( such as the prefects of congregations ) cease immediately to hold office , the only exceptions being the Major Penitentiary , who continues his important role regarding absolutions and dispensations , and the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church , who administers the temporalities ( i .e

53	Peter during this period . 
54	The government of the See , and therefore of the Catholic Church , then falls to the College of Cardinals . 
55	Canon law prohibits the College and the Camerlengo from introducing any innovations or novelties in the government of the Church during this period . 
56	In 2001 , the Holy See had a revenue of 422.098&nbsp;billion 
57	Italian lire ( about 202&nbsp;million USD at the time ) , and a net income of 17.720&nbsp;billion

59	Zenit 6 July 2001 Legal status of the Holy See The Holy See has been recognized , both in state practice and in the writing of modern legal scholars , as a subject of public international law , with rights and duties analogous to those of States . 
60	Although the Holy See , as distinct from the Vatican City State , does not fulfil the long-established criteria in international law of statehood —having a permanent population , a defined territory , a stable government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states The criteria for statehood where first authoritatively enunciated at the Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States , signed on 26 December 1933 . 
61	—its possession of full legal personality in international law is shown by the fact that it maintains diplomatic relations with 178 states , that it is a member-state in various intergovernmental international organizations , and that it is : "respected by the international community of sovereign States and treated as a subject of international law having the capacity to engage in diplomatic relations and to enter into binding agreements with one , several , or many states under international law that are largely geared to establish and preserving peace in the world .

88	The Holy See is a member of various International organizations and groups including the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , International Telecommunication Union , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE) , the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . 
89	The Holy See is also a permanent observer in various international organizations , including the United Nations General Assembly , the Council of Europe , UNESCO ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , and the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) . 
90	Although the Holy See is closely associated with the Vatican City , the independent territory over which the Holy See is sovereign , the two entities are separate and distinct . 
91	After the Italian takeover of the Papal States in 1870 , the Holy See had no territorial sovereignty . 
92	In spite of some uncertainty among jurist as to whether it could continue to act as an independent personality in international matters , the Holy See continued in fact to exercise the right to send and receive diplomatic representatives , maintaining relations with states that included the major powers of Russia , Prussia and Austria-Hungary . 
93	Where , in accordance with the decision of the 1815 Congress of Vienna , the Nuncio was not only a member of the Diplomatic Corps but its Dean , this arrangement continued to be accepted by the other ambassadors . 
94	In the course of the 59 years during which the Holy See held no territorial sovereignty , the number of states that had diplomatic relations with it , which had been reduced to 16 , actually increased to 29 .

110	Foreign embassies are accredited to the Holy See , not to the Vatican City , and it is the Holy See that establishes treaties and concordat with other sovereign entities . 
111	When necessary , the Holy See will enter a treaty on behalf of the Vatican City . 
112	Under the terms of the Lateran Treaty , the Holy See has extraterritorial authority over 23 sites in Rome and five Italian sites outside of Rome , including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo . 
113	The same authority is extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in a foreign country . 
114	Every episcopal see is considered holy . 
115	In Greek , the adjective "holy " or " sacred " ( ἱερά ) is constantly applied to all such sees as a matter of course . 
116	In the West , the adjective is not commonly added , but it does form part of an official title of two sees : as well as Rome , the Bishopric of Mainz ( the former Archbishopric of Mainz ) , which was also of electoral and primatial rank , bears the title of " the Holy See of Mainz " ( Latin : Sancta Sedes Moguntina ) . 
117	The term " see " comes from the Latin word " sedes " , meaning " seat" , which refers to the Episcopal throne ( cathedra ) . 
118	The term " Apostolic See " can refer to any see founded by one of the Apostles , but , when used with the definite article , it is used in the Catholic Church to refer specifically to the see of the Bishop of Rome , whom that Church sees as successor of Saint Peter , the head of the apostles .
