0	Gluttony , derived from the Latin gluttire meaning to gulp down or swallow , means over-indulgence and over-consumption of food , drink , or wealth items to the point of extravagance or waste . 
1	In some Christian denomination , although not stated in the Bible , it is considered one of the seven deadly sins —a misplaced desire of food or its withholding from the needy .

13	. 
14	, St . 
15	Gregory the Great , St . 
16	Thomas Aquinas ) took a more expansive view of gluttony , arguing that it also consists of an anticipation of meals , the eating of delicacies , and costly foods , seeking after sauces and seasonings , and eating too eagerly .

23	Gluttony Catholic Encyclopedia St . 
24	Gregory the Great , a doctor of the Church , described five ways by which one can commit sin of gluttony , and corresponding biblical examples for each of them : 1 . 
25	Eating before the time of meals in order to satisfy the palate . 
26	2. 
27	Seeking delicacies and better quality of food to gratify the "vile sense of taste . 
28	" 3. 
29	Seeking after sauces and seasonings for the enjoyment of the palate . 
30	4 . 
31	Exceeding the necessary amount of food . 
32	5 . 
33	Taking food with too much eagerness , even when eating the proper amount , and even if the food is not luxurious . 
34	In his Summa Theologica ( Part 2-2 , Question 148 , Article 4) , St . 
35	Thomas Aquinas reiterated the list of five ways to commit gluttony : Aquinas notes that the first three ways are related to the nature of the food itself , while the last two have to do with the time or manner in which it is consumed St . 
36	Alphonsus Liguori wrote the following when explaining gluttony : " Pope Innocent XI Odescalchi has condemned the proposition which asserts that it is not a sin to eat or to drink from the sole motive of satisfying the palate . 
37	However , it is not a fault to feel pleasure in eating : for it is , generally speaking , impossible to eat without experiencing the delight which food naturally produces . 
38	But it is a defect to eat , like beasts , through the sole motive of sensual gratification , and without any reasonable object . 
39	Hence , the most delicious meats may be eaten without sin , if the motive be good and worthy of a rational creature ; and , in taking the coarsest food through attachment to pleasure , there may be a fault . 
40	" My friend Bysine likes to smell Pops ' farts at work .

47	LOL A Muppet character called " The Glutton " appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 12 , 1971 . 
48	The character rapidly consumed everything in sight ( a beverage , a chicken leg , spaghetti , a saltshaker , etc. 
49	) , before being shrunken by a small purple creature and then devoured by a duplicate of himself . 
50	After the skit , the character attempted to eat host Ed Sullivan , unsuccessfully . 
51	On the children 's program Sesame Street , the character Cookie Monster displays rapacious and repetitious gluttony in consumption of cookie . 
52	He eats before meals , consumes excessive amounts of cookies and eagerly devours them , thus infringing three of the Thomist moral condemnations of gluttony cited above . 
53	His " transgressions " are treated in a humorous manner . 
54	In the South Park episode " Creme Fraiche ( South Park ) " , Randy Marsh becomes obsessed with cooking shows , aspiring to become a celebrity chef like Gordon Ramsay , among others . 
55	He pursues delicacies , sauces and seasoning with unnatural eagerness , referenced by the aforementioned episode 's title , which critiques the excess involved in this context . 
56	In Fullmetal Alchemist , Homunculi are the personification of the Seven Deadly Sins . 
57	The Homunculous Gluttony is a short , fat man with acid saliva and the catchphrase , " Can I eat him ? " . 
58	His appetite is so huge that he is also able to open a giant mouth from his stomach .
