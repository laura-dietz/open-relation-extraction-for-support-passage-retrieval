27	The Greek word Χριστιανός ( christianos )—meaning "follower of Christ "—comes from Χριστός ( christos )—meaning " anointed one " at Etymology Online —with an adjectival ending borrowed from Latin to denote adhering to , or even belonging to , as in slave ownership . 
28	Bickerman_ 1949 p . 
29	147 , All these Greek terms , formed with the Latin suffix -ianus , exactly as the Latin words of the same derivation , express the idea that the men or things referred to , belong to the person to whose name the suffix is added . 
30	p . 
31	145 , In Latin this suffix produced proper names of the type Marcianus and , on the other hand , derivatives from the name of a person , which referred to his belongings , like fundus Narcissianus , or , by extension , to his adherents , Ciceroniani . 
32	In the Greek Septuagint , christos was used to translate the Hebrew מָשִׁיח ַ ( Mašíaḥ , messiah ) , meaning " [one who is ] anointed .

34	The first recorded use of the term ( or its cognate in other languages ) is in the New Testament , in Acts 11:26 , which states " ...in 
35	Antioch the disciples were first called Christians . 
36	" The second mention of the term follows in Acts 26 :28 , where Herod Agrippa II replies to Paul the Apostle , " Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian ? " The third and final New Testament reference to the term is in 1pe 4:16 NIV 1 Peter 4:16 , which exhorts believers , " ...if 
37	you suffer as a Christian , do not be ashamed , but praise God that you bear that name . 
38	" Another term for Christians which appears in the New Testament is " Nazarenes " which is used by the Jewish lawyer Tertullus in Acts 24 . 
39	Tertullian ( Against Marcion 4:8 ) records that " the Jews call us Nazarenes , " while around 331 AD Eusebius records that Christ was called a Nazoraean from the name Nazareth , and that in earlier centuries " Christians , " were once called " Nazarenes . 
40	" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies : Volume 65 , Issue 1 University of London . 
41	School of Oriental and African Studies - 2002 " ... 
42	around 331 , Eusebius says of the place name Nazareth that 'from this name the Christ was called a Nazoraean , and in ancient times we , who are now called Christians , were once called Nazarenes ' ;6 thus he attributes this designation .. 
43	. 
44	" The Hebrew equivalent of " Nazarenes " , Notzrim , occurs in the Babylonian Talmud , and is still the modern Israeli Hebrew term for Christian . 
45	All three original New Testament usages verses reflect a derisive element in the term Christian to refer to followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome .

53	The city of Antioch in Syria had a reputation for coining nicknames . 
54	However Peter 's apparent endorsement of the term , led to it being preferred over " Nazarenes " and the term Christianoi from 1 Peter becomes the standard term in the Early Church Fathers from Ignatius and Polycarp onwards .
