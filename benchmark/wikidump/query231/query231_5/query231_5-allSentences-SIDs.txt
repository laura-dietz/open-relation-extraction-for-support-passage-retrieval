0	June 2009 In the Christian moral tradition , sloth ( Latin : acedia , accidia , pigritia ) is one of the seven capital sins , often called the seven deadly sins ; these sins are called deadly sins because they supposedly destroy the charity in a person 's heart and thus may lead to eternal death . 
1	Sloth is defined as spiritual or emotional apathy , neglecting what God has spoken , and being physically and emotionally inactive . 
2	Acedia is a Latin word , from Greek ἁκηδείᾱ , meaning " Carelessness " . 
3	Sloth can also indicate a wasting due to lack of use , concerning a person , place , thing , skill , or intangible ideal that would require maintenance , refinement , or support to continue to exist . 
4	Religious views concerning the need for one to work to support society and further God 's plan and work also suggest that , through inactivity , one invites the desire to sin . 
5	" For Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do . 
6	" ( "Against Idleness and Mischief " by Isaac Watts ) . 
7	< In the Philokalia the word dejection is used instead of sloth , for the person who falls into dejection will lose interest in life . 
8	Although , as defined above , sloth is more akin to depression , many English speakers narrow it to simple laziness , about which the Bible makes many comments .
