1	Lust is an emotional force that is directly associated with the thinking or fantasizing about one 's desire , usually in a sexual way . 
2	Richard Lazarus with Bernice N Lazarus , Passion and Reason : Making Sense of Our Emotions , 1994 , New York : Oxford University Press ISBN 978-0195104615 The word lust is phonetically similar to the ancient Roman lustrum , which literally meant "purification " . 
3	This was the five-year cycle time for the ritual expiation of " sins " called the lustration as practiced in ancient Greek and Roman cultures , occasionally involving human sacrifice . 
4	Sexual intercourse was one of a list of sins requiring lustration . 
5	Another similar word existed in ancient Latin , lustratio . 
6	Lustration Lustration The Seven Deadly Sins , written during the 5th century is a similar list of sins requiring expiation or forgiveness . 
7	These doctrines forbade even thoughts and desires for fornicatio ( fornication ) , later generalized as luxuria ( lust/lechery ) .

28	The concept also was progressively embodied in debates about mandatory Clerical celibacy beginning in the 1st through 5th centuries and following . 
29	For example , Henry Charles Lea states that " Sixtus III barely admits that married persons can obtain eternal life " in his " Sacerdotal History of Christian Celibacy " ( p.&nbsp;45 
30	) . 
31	He also states , " Siricius and Innocent I ransacked the Gospels for texts of more than doubtful application with which to support the innovation <of required celibacy >" . 
32	( p.&nbsp;53 
33	) However , in the 11th to 15th centuries the northern European usage of the verb still meant simply " to please , delight ; " or "pleasure " . 
34	A related form "lusty" , originally meant " joyful , merry " or "full of healthy vigor" .

42	2011-11-21 The word "lust " began being used in the 16th century in the Protestant Reformation 's early non-Latin Bible translations . 
43	This is despite the fact that the original Koine Greek Bible has no single word that is uniquely translated as heterosexual lust . 
44	q.v. 
45	Today , the meaning of the word still has differing meanings as shown in the Merriam-Webster definition . 
46	Lust : 1 . 
47	a : pleasure , delight b : personal inclination : wish 2. 
48	intense or unbridled sexual desire : lasciviousness 3. 
49	a : intense longing : craving <a lust to succeed > b : enthusiasm , eagerness <admired his lust for life> .

54	2011-11-21 Five Precepts In translations of the New Testament , the word "lust " is occasionally used as a translation of the Koiné Greek word , 'επιθυμία' , and in its various forms . 
55	The related word 'ἐπιθυμέω ' is rendered as "lust " in the oft-quoted King James Version verse here : However , this verse represents the only instance 'ἐπιθυμέω ' is rendered as 'lust ' in the New International Version of the Christian Bible . 
56	Further insight can be gained from Jesus Christ describing His own feelings using both of these word forms in Luke 22:15 : Note also that doubling two similar words in Koine Greek is not mere redundancy . 
57	Rather , it is a common semantic mechanism to accomplish the emphatic voice . 
58	Various versions therefore render Christ 's words in Luke 22:15 as "eagerly desired " NIV , "great desire " BBE , "fervent desire " NKJV , "earnestly desired " WEB , RSV . 
59	Obviously , Mt 5:27–28 has no expression of intense desire using this mechanism . 
60	This analysis raises several questions in Biblical Hermeneutics . 
61	Did Christ deprecate even casual heterosexual desire in Mt 5:28 ? Is all heterosexual desire lust ? There are several understandings of Mt 5:27–28 that attempt to answer these questions . 
62	leftthumbA demon satiating his lust in a 13th century manuscript . 
63	thumbRomanesque artRomanesqueCapital (architecture)capitalrepresenting the lust According to the Catholic Encyclopedia , a Christian 's heart is lustful when "venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or , at any rate , in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse " . 
64	Pope John Paul II states that lust is totally different from the natural desire for sexual love of man and woman . 
65	Pope John Paul II , Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust .L'Osservatore 
66	Romano , Weekly Edition in English , 22 September 1980 , p . 
67	11 Lust is considered by Catholicism to be a disordered desire for sexual pleasure , where sexual pleasure is " sought for itself , isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes " . 
68	'' Catechism of the Catholic Church _ n° 2351 sq . 
69	" In Catholicism , sexual desire in itself is good , and is considered part of God 's plan for humanity . 
70	However , when sexual desire is separated from God 's love , it becomes disordered and self seeking . 
71	This is seen as lust . 
72	In Roman Catholicism , lust became one of the Seven deadly sins , taking the place of extravagance ( Latin : luxuria ) . 
73	February 2011 This change occurred because in the Romance languages , the cognate of luxuria ( the Latin name of the sin ) evolved to have an exclusively sexual meaning ; February 2011 the Old French cognate was adopted into English as luxury , but this lost its sexual meaning by the 14th century . 
74	February 2011 In the Romanesque art , lust is often represented by a siren or a naked woman with breast bitten by snakes . 
75	In the Bhagavad Gita , Lord Krishna , an Avatar of Vishnu declared in verse 21 , that lust is one of the gates to Naraka or hell . 
76	" Arjuna said : O descendant of Vrsni , by what is one impelled to sin acts , even unwillingly , as if engaged by force ? Then Krishna said : It is lust only , Arjuna , which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath , and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world . 
77	As fire is covered by smoke , as a mirror is covered by dust , or as the embryo is covered by the womb , the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust . 
78	Thus the wise living entity 's pure consciousness becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust , which is never satisfied and which burns like fire . 
79	The senses , the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust . 
80	Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him . 
81	Therefore , O Arjuna , best of the Bharatas , in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin —( lust ) by regulating the senses , and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization . 
82	The working senses are superior to dull matter ; mind is higher than the senses ; intelligence is still higher than the mind ; and he [the soul ] is even higher than the intelligence . 
83	Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses , mind and intelligence , O mighty-armed Arjuna , one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength — conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust . 
84	" ( Bhagavad-Gita , 3.36–43 
85	) In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word ' Lust ' is best comprehended as the psychological force called ' Wanting ' . 
86	In Islam , intentional lascivious glances are forbidden . 
87	Lascivious thoughts are disliked , for they are the first step towards adultery , rape and other antisocial behaviors . 
88	But in Islam , " Desire for the opposite sex " is not forbidden ( haram ) as it is natural ..The 
89	Prophet Muhammad had his fears about lust as he once said , " The fornication of the eyes is to look with lust ; the fornication of the tongue is to speak lustful things ; the fornication of the hands is to touch with lust ; the fornication of the feet is to walk towards lust ; the fornication of the heart is to desire evil . 
90	" November 2009 , the prophet also stressed the magnitude of the " second glance" , as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just observatory , the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking . 
91	Islam does not advocate celibacy but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally . 
92	So in conclusion Islam prohibits the actions that may lead to forbidden sexual acts , especially lustful gazing , to decrease the probability of " sinful " behavior . 
93	In Judaism , all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by yetzer hara ( Hebrew , יצר הרע ) . 
94	Yetzer hara is not a demonic force ; rather , it is man 's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive , and is often contrasted with yetzer hatov . 
95	This idea was derived from Genesis 8:21 , which states that " the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth " August 2011 . 
96	Yetzer hara is often identified with Satan and the angel of death , Bava Bathra 16a Bava Bathra 16a and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the Yetzer . 
97	For the Yetzer , like Satan , misleads man in this world , and testifies against him in the world to come . 
98	August 2011 Yetzer is , however , clearly distinguished from Satan , and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin . 
99	The Torah is considered the great antidote against this force . 
100	Though , like all things which God has made , the Yetzer is good : for without it , man would never marry , beget a child , build a house , or trade . 
101	Few ancient , pagan religions have actually considered lust to be a vice . 
102	August 2011 The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual would be the Bacchanalias of the Ancient Roman Bacchantes . 
103	However , this activity was soon outlawed by the Roman Senate in 186 BC in the decree Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus . 
104	The practice of sacred prostitution , however , continued to be an activity practiced often by the Dionysians . 
105	In Sikhism , lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities ( the others being anger , ego , greed and attachment ) . 
106	In common usage , the term stands for wanting to have sex and it is in this sense that it is considered an evil if uncontrolled in Sikhism . 
107	According to Brahma Kumaris , a spiritual organisation which is based on Hindu philosphy , sex lust is the greatest enemy to mankind Through open doors : a view of Asian cultures in Kenya .

120	From Ovid to the works of les poètes maudits , characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery , and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature . 
121	Many writers , such as Georges Bataille , Casanova and Prosper Mérimée , have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place . 
122	Despite the apparent evils of Baudelaire , author of Les fleurs du mal , he had once remarked , in regard to the artist , that " The more a man cultivates the arts , the less randy he becomes ... 
123	Only the brute is good at coupling , and copulation is the lyricism of the masses . 
124	To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself " . 
125	The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust , and all of the Seven Deadly Sins , is Dante 's la Divina Commedia . 
126	Dante 's criterion for lust was an "excessive love of others , " insofar as an excessive love for man would render one 's love of God secondary . 
127	In the first canticle of Dante 's Inferno , the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind , which symbolizes their passions . 
128	The damned who are guilty of lust , like the two famous lovers , Paolo and Francesca , receive what they desired in their mortal lives , their passions never give them rest for all eternity . 
129	In Purgatorio , of the selfsame work , the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations . 
130	The link between love and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy . 
131	Schopenhauer notes the misery which results from sexual relationships . 
132	According to him , this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse . 
133	For , he states , the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face , at any price , the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome . 
134	He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce , and wants only to think . 
135	The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust . 
136	In many religious doctrines lust is loosely defined with the result that it is often equated and confused with the physical expression of love in the sexual act . 
137	Barry Long states that lusting is only the thinking about sex , and this thinking about the natural sexual energy gives rise to a separate powerful emotional condition known as lust . 
138	This emotional condition is the problem in love . 
139	A quote from Barry Long on the subject of celibacy ( with regard to being free of sexual force ) clarifies his definition of love : " You don’t need a celibate body , you need a celibate mind " Gold Coast Talks audio April 1998 A celibate mind is a mind free of lust . 
140	He states that the natural attraction between the sexes is pure and holy . 
141	The physical act of sex in the absence of wanting and trying , thinking and fantasizing( lust ) , results in the creation of a state of love in the bodies . 
142	The error in love is to think about sex .

152	Lust is an interior , psychological action . 
153	Lechery is behaviour , a physical manifestation or behavioural pattern of an interior condition ( lust ) . 
154	Lust does not necessarily result in the action of lechery . 
155	The dictionary definition confirms that lechery is a behaviour : inordinate indulgence in sexual activity ; unrestrained and promiscuous sexuality ; immoderate indulgence of sexual desire ; lewd and lustful behavior . 
156	libido Lust , in the domain of psychoanalysis and psychology , is often treated as a case of " heightened libido " .A 
157	person is more likely to lust over someone who does not resemble oneself . 
158	Self - relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted . 
159	Therefore , self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire creating a higher possibility of lust .

184	2011-11-21 The most permissive view rejects the 16th century translation to "lust " . 
185	This view centers instead on the word "woman " ( γυνή in Koine Greek , ) . 
186	It is taken to mean simply "another man 's wife " . 
187	The KJV renders γυνή as "wife " in 92 of its 201 uses in the Koine Greek Bible . 
188	The context of half of those remaining imply that the woman is at least a mother ( e .g 
189	. 
190	having children , etc. 
191	) , or has a husband , or has prior commitments in some fashion . 
192	The presence of the word "adultery " also supports this view . 
193	Thus , Mt 5:28 says simply that one is never to covetously desire another man 's wife / possession even with a mere look . 
194	Value judgments on all other heterosexual desires are therefore considered unstated . 
195	. 
196	A more traditional view accepts the "lust " translation as if it were inspired by God . 
197	June 2011 It considers almost all heterosexual desire August 2011 outside marriage to be sin . 
198	Romance is usually considered to be non-sexual and is often , therefore , acceptable . 
199	This approach is represented in the book " I Kissed Dating Goodbye " by Joshua Harris . 
200	A more demanding approach is to accept the principles of Celibacy as practiced within Clerical celibacy in several world religions , including those by greater Roman Catholicism , Eastern Orthodoxy , and historically by the medieval Cathars http ://www.1911encyclopedia 
201	.org/Cathars 
202	( e .g 
203	. 
204	the "perfect " ) and others . 
205	An elaboration of this view is in the titled Roman Catholic section below . 
206	q.v. 
207	The final view in this pseudo-continuum considers this verse to be an endorsement of male Homosexuality . 
208	In Mt 5:28 , Jesus Christ seems to forbid even casual desire for any woman . 
209	Several of the extra-biblical ( and disputed ) apocryphal books , ( e .g 
210	. 
211	the Secret Gospel of Mark ) embody and elaborate this approach .

216	relates a saying among monks in the early Saint Catherine 's Monastery that " With wine and boys around , monks have no need of the devil to tempt them . 
217	" Thus , homosexuality is considered in this unusual view to be the most spiritual state possible in matters of sexual desire . 
218	See the Lavender Mafia and Homosexuality and Roman Catholic priests .
