81	It is this Magisterium 's task to preserve God 's people from deviations and defections and to guarantee them the objective possibility of professing the true faith without error . 
82	Thus , the pastoral duty of the Magisterium is aimed at seeing to it that the People of God abides in the truth that liberates . 
83	To fulfill this service , Christ endowed the Church 's shepherds with the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals . 
84	The exercise of this charism takes several forms : " Catholic worship is centred on the Eucharist , in which the Church teaches that the sacramental bread and wine are transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ . 
85	The Church holds the Blessed Virgin Mary in special regard .

109	The combination " the Catholic Church " ( he katholike ekklesia ) is found for the first time in the letter of St Ignatius , written about the year 110 . 
110	The words run : " Wheresoever the bishop shall appear , there let the people be , even as where Jesus may be , there is the universal [katholike ] Church .

113	St Cyril writes , " And if ever thou art sojourning in any city , inquire not simply where the Lord 's house is--for the sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens , houses of the Lord--nor merely where the church is , but where is the Catholic Church .

118	Since the East-West Schism of 1054 , the churches that remained in communion with the See of Rome ( the diocese of Rome and its bishop , the Pope , the primal patriarch ) continued to call itself " Catholic " , while the Eastern churches that rejected the Pope 's primal authority have generally been known as " Orthodox " or " Eastern Orthodox " . 
119	Following the Reformation in the 16th century , the Church continued to use the term " Catholic " to distinguish itself from the various Protestant denominations that split off .

263	CCC , 1200–1209 In the definition of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches , " a rite is the liturgical , theological , spiritual and disciplinary patrimony , culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people , by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church sui iuris " , The is " Ritus est patrimonium liturgicum , theologicum , spirituale et disciplinare cultura ac rerum adiunctis historiae populorum distinctum , quod modo fidei vivendae uniuscuiusque Ecclesiae sui iuris proprio exprimitur . 
264	" ( A rite is the liturgical , theological , spiritual and disciplinary heritage , differentiated by peoples ' culture and historical circumstances , that finds expression in each sui iuris Church 's own way of living the faith ) . 
265	but the term is often limited to liturgical patrimony . 
266	The most commonly used liturgy is the Roman Rite , but even in the Latin Catholic Church a few other rites are in use , and the Eastern Catholic Churches have distinct rites . 
267	In all rites the Mass , or Divine Liturgy , is the centre of Catholic worship . 
268	The Catholic Church teaches that at each Mass the bread and wine are supernaturally transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ by the words of consecration spoken by the priest . 
269	CCC , 1324–1331 The words of consecration are drawn from the three synoptic Gospels and a Pauline letter . 
270	Luke 22:19 Matthew 26 :27–28 Mark 14:22–24 1Corinthians 11:24–25 See Luke 22:19 , Matthew 26 :27–28 , Mark 14:22–24 , 1Corinthians 11:24–25 The Church teaches that Christ established a New Covenant with humanity through the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper , as described in these biblical verses .

289	326 there are strict rules about who may celebrate and who may receive the Eucharist . 
290	The sacrament can only be celebrated by an ordained Catholic priest or bishop . 
291	Those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden from receiving the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation ( Penance ) . 
292	Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament . 
293	Kreeft , p . 
294	331 Catholics are not permitted to receive the Eucharist as celebrated in Protestant churches , which in the view of the Catholic Church lack the sacrament of Holy Orders , and thus also lack a valid Eucharist .

301	2011-06-30 Likewise , Protestants are not normally permitted to receive communion in the Catholic Church . 
302	This is because unity with the Catholic faith is seen as necessary before one can partake of the Church 's sacraments . 
303	In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See , the Catholic Church is less restrictive , declaring that " a certain communion in sacris , and so in the Eucharist , given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority , is not merely possible but is encouraged .

332	The Eastern Catholic Churches are either groups of faithful that have restored full communion with the Bishop of Rome , while preserving their unique identity as Eastern Christians , or groups with which full communion has never been broken .

334	In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to some degree of liturgical Latinisation .

353	2011-06-30 Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 book Catholic Bible . 
354	This is made up of the 46 books found in the ancient Greek version of the Old Testament —known as the Septuagint Schreck , p . 
355	21 —and the 27&nbsp; New Testament writings first found in the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 and listed in Athanasius ' Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter .

358	Schreck , pp . 
359	15–19 Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the "deposit of faith " ( depositum fidei ) . 
360	These are in turn interpreted by the Magisterium ( from magister , Latin for "teacher " ) , the Church 's teaching authority , which is exercised by the Pope and the College of Bishops in union with the Pope , the bishop of Rome . 
361	Schreck , p . 
362	30 thumbright200px '' Crucifixion of Christ ''by Albrecht Altdorfer _ 1526 The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God , who exists as a mutual indwelling of three persons : God the Father ; God the Son ; and the Holy Spirit , which make up the Trinity . 
363	Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity , God the Son . 
364	In an event known as the Incarnation , through the power of the Holy Spirit , God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary . 
365	Christ therefore is both fully divine and fully human . 
366	It is taught that Christ 's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels . 
367	McGrath , pp . 
368	4–6 . 
369	The Church teaches that through the passion ( suffering ) of Christ and his crucifixion as described in the Gospels , all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin , and so can be reconciled to God . 
370	CCC , 608 The Resurrection of Jesus gained for humans a possible spiritual immortality previously denied to them because of original sin . 
371	Schreck , p .

373	By reconciling with God and following Christ 's words and deeds , an individual can enter the Kingdom of God , which is the " ...&nbsp;reign 
374	of God over people 's hearts and lives " . 
375	Barry , p . 
376	26 The Greek term " Christ " and the Hebrew " Messiah " both mean "anointed one" , referring to the Christian belief that Jesus ' death and resurrection are the fulfillment of the Old Testament 's Messianic prophecies . 
377	Kreeft , pp . 
378	71–72 According to the Catechism , the Catholic Church professes to be the " sole Church of Christ " , which is described in the Nicene Creed as the One _ Holy _ Catholic_ and Apostolic Church . 
379	CCC , . 
380	The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ , who appointed the twelve Apostles to continue his work as the Church 's earliest bishops . 
381	Kreeft , p . 
382	98 , quote " The fundamental reason for being a Catholic is the historical fact that the Catholic Church was founded by Christ , was God 's invention , not man 's&nbsp;...&nbsp;As 
383	the Father gave authority to Christ ( Jn 5:22 ; Mt 28:18–20 ) , Christ passed it on to his apostles ( Lk 10:16 ) , and they passed it on to the successors they appointed as bishops . 
384	" Catholic belief holds that the Church "is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth" , Schreck , p . 
385	131 and that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal succession from the apostles .

391	Accessed Aug 20 , 2011 The Church teaches that the fullness of the "means of salvation " exists only in the Catholic Church , but the Church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to "impel towards Catholic unity " and thus bring people to salvation .

401	Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God 's presence and effective channels of God 's grace to all those who receive them with the proper disposition ( ex opere operato ) . 
402	Kreeft , pp . 
403	298–299 The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorises the sacraments into three groups , the " sacraments of Christian initiation" , " sacraments of healing " and " sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful" . 
404	These groups broadly reflect the stages of people 's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve .

657	2011-06-30 The Church teaches that , immediately after death , the soul of each person will receive a particular judgment from God . 
658	CCC , 1021–22 , 1051 This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in a universal judgment of all mankind . 
659	This final judgment , according to Church teaching , will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness . 
660	CCC , 1038–41 The basis on which each person 's soul is judged is detailed in the Gospel of Matthew , which lists works of mercy to be performed even to people considered " the least of Christ 's brothers " . 
661	Matthew 25:35–36 Matthew 25:35–36 Emphasis is upon Christ 's words that " Not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' shall enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" . 
662	According to the Catechism , " The Last Judgement will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life . 
663	" Schreck , p . 
664	397 Depending on the judgement rendered , a soul may enter one of three states of afterlife : leftthumbTheBlessed Virgin Maryis highly regarded in the Catholic Church _ proclaiming her asTheotokosMother of God _ sinless _ free fromoriginal sinand as anintercessor . 
665	Blessed Virgin Mary ( Roman Catholic ) Roman Catholic Mariology Mary ( mother of Jesus ) Devotions to Mary are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God . 
666	Schreck , p . 
667	199–200 The Church holds Mary , as Perpetual Virgin and Mother of God , in special regard . 
668	Catholic beliefs concerning Mary include her Immaculate Conception without the stain of original sin and bodily assumption into heaven at the end of her life , both of which have been infallibly defined as dogma , by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and Pope Pius XII in 1950 respectively . 
669	Barry , p . 
670	106 Mariology deals not only with her life but also her veneration in daily life , prayer and Marian art , music and architecture . 
671	Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven . 
672	Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because , by giving birth to Christ , she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ . 
673	Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus , prayers and devotions such as the Rosary , the Hail Mary , the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices .

687	Catholic tradition and doctrine holds that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD in Judea within the Roman Empire .

693	The Catholic Church teaches that the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles , in an event known as Pentecost , signalled the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church . 
694	Barry , p . 
695	46 . 
696	Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community . 
697	It interprets the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew as Christ 's designation of Saint Peter the Apostle and his successors , the Bishops of Rome to be the temporal head of his Church , a doctrine known as apostolic succession . 
698	The Catholic Church recognizes as legitimate the episcopal consecrations of a number of other churches . 
699	However , it still insists that those churches are obligated to defer to the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff . 
700	Hitchcock , Geography of Religion ( 2004 ) , p . 
701	281 , quote : " Some ( Christian communities ) had been founded by Peter , the disciple Jesus designated as the founder of his church .&nbsp;...&nbsp;Once 
702	the position was institutionalized , historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome " Norman , The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History ( 2007 ) , pp . 
703	11 , 14 , quote : " The Church was founded by Jesus himself in his earthly lifetime ." 
704	, " The apostolate was established in Rome , the world 's capital when the church was inaugurated ; it was there that the universality of the Christian teaching most obviously took its central directive&ndash ;it was the bishops of Rome who very early on began to receive requests for adjudication on disputed points from other bishops .

712	The empire 's well-defined network of roads and waterways allowed for easier travel , while the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another . 
713	The government had encouraged inhabitants , especially those in urban areas , to learn Greek , and the common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood . 
714	Bokenkotter , p . 
715	24 . 
716	Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire , however , Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods , a practice adopted from Judaism ( see Idolatry ) . 
717	The Christians ' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life , which caused non - Christians &ndash ;including government authorities&ndash;to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire . 
718	The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century . 
719	MacCulloch , Christianity , pp . 
720	155&ndash ;159 , 164 . 
721	In 313 , the struggles of the Early Church were lessened by the legalisation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I . 
722	In 380 , Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree of the Emperor , which would persist until the fall of the Western Empire and , later , with the Eastern Roman Empire until the Fall of Constantinople . 
723	During this time ( the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils ) there were considered five primary sees according to Eusebius : Rome , Constantinople , Antioch , Jerusalem and Alexandria , known as the Pentarchy . 
724	After the destruction of the western Roman Empire , the church in the West was a major factor in the preservation of classical civilisation , establishing monasteries and sending missionaries to convert the peoples of northern Europe as far as Ireland in the north . 
725	In the East , the Byzantine Empire preserved Orthodoxy well after the massive invasions of Islam in the mid-7th century . 
726	The invasions of Islam devastated three of the five Patriarchal see , capturing Jerusalem first , then Alexandria , and then finally , in the mid-8th century , Antioch . 
727	The whole period of the next five centuries was dominated by the struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin . 
728	The battles of Poitiers and Toulouse preserved the Catholic west even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850 and Constantinople was besieged . 
729	Criticism of Catholic actions in history In the 11th century , already strained relations between the primarily Greek church in the East and the Latin church in the West developed into the East-West Schism partially due to conflicts over Papal authority . 
730	The fourth crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach . 
731	In the 16th century , in response to the Protestant Reformation , the Catholic Church engaged in a process of substantial reform and renewal , known as the Counter-Reformation . 
732	Norman 81 In subsequent centuries , Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment . 
733	In 1854 Pope Pius IX with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic bishops , whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853 , proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception .

816	11 October 1996 2010-10-28 Catholic teachings on sexual morality Catholic ordination of women Soon after the close of the Second Vatican Council , Church teachings about sexuality became an issue of increasing controversy due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world ( see the Sexual Revolution ) .

823	2008-02-02 ( 1968 ) , Pope Paul VI rejected all artificial contraception ( though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning ) , contradicting those voices in the Church that saw at the time the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception . 
824	This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae , where he decried contraception and abortion as well as euthanasia as symptoms of a " culture of death " and called for a " culture of life " .

828	493–494 Efforts in support of the ordination of women led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Pope against the proposal , as in 1976 ( Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood ) , 1988 ( Mulieris Dignitatem ) , and 1994 ( Ordinatio Sacerdotalis ) . 
829	According to the latest ruling found in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis , then Pope John Paul II concluded , " I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church 's faithful .

831	Retrieved 2011-06-05 In defiance of these rulings , opposition groups such as Roman Catholic Womenpriests have performed alleged ordination ceremonies ( according to canon law , such ceremonies are not either licit or illicit , valid or invalid , but are the simulation of the sacrament of Ordination , as they are held not confer the sacrament ) Codex Iuris Canonici , canon 1378 for women , claiming the aid of a Catholic bishop in performing the rites .

841	In the 1990s and 2000s , the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy became the subject of media coverage and public debate in the United States , Ireland , Australia and other countries . 
842	The Church was criticized for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests , transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offenses . 
843	In response to the scandal , the Church has established formal procedures to prevent abuse , encourage reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly , although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness .
