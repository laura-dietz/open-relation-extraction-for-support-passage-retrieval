0	Seven Deadly Sins ( disambiguation ) thumb300pxHieronymus Bosch 's '' The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things '' The 7 Deadly Sins , also known as the Capital Vices or Cardinal Sins , is a classification of objectionable vices that have been used since early Christian times to educate and instruct followers concerning fallen humanity 's tendency to sin . 
1	The currently recognized version of the sins are usually given as wrath , greed , sloth , pride , lust , envy , and gluttony . 
2	The Catholic Church divides sin into two categories : venial sin , in which guilt is relatively minor , and the more severe mortal sin . 
3	Theologically , a mortal sin is believed to destroy the life of grace within the person and thus creates the threat of eternal damnation . 
4	" Mortal sin , by attacking the vital principle within us - that is , charity - necessitates a new initiative of God 's mercy and a conversion of heart which is normally accomplished [for Catholics ] within the setting of the sacrament of reconciliation .

9	The Deadly Sins do not belong to an additional category of sin . 
10	Rather , they are the sins that are seen as the origin ( " capital " comes from the Latin caput , head ) of the other sins . 
11	A "deadly sin " can be either venial or mortal , depending on the situation ; but " they are called 'capital ' because they engender other sins , other vices . 
12	" Catechism of the Catholic Church , n . 
13	1866 . 
14	Beginning in the early 14th century , the popularity of the seven deadly sins as a theme among European artists of the time eventually helped to ingrain them in many areas of Catholic culture and Catholic consciousness in general throughout the world . 
15	One means of such ingraining was the creation of the mnemonic " SALIGIA " based on the first letters in Latin of the seven deadly sins : superbia , avaritia , luxuria , invidia , gula , ira , acedia .

19	" namely : Proverbs 6:16–19 Proverbs 6:16–19 While there are seven of them , this list is considerably different from the traditional one , with only pride clearly being in both lists . 
20	Another list , given this time by the Epistle to the Galatians ( Galatians 5:19-21 ) , includes more of the traditional seven sins , although the list is substantially longer : adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , idolatry , sorcery , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , " and such like " . 
21	Galatians 5:19-21 Galatians 5:19-21 Since Saint Paul goes on to say that the persons who commit these sins " shall not inherit the Kingdom of God" , they are usually listed as ( possible ) mortal sins rather than Capital Vices .

23	The modern concept of the Seven Deadly Sins is linked to the works of the 4th century monk Evagrius Ponticus , who listed eight evil thoughts in Greek as follows : Evagrio Pontico , Gli Otto Spiriti Malvagi , trans . 
24	, Felice Comello , Pratiche Editrice , Parma , 1990 , p.11-12 
25	. 
26	They were translated into the Latin of Western Christianity ( largely due to the writings of John Cassian April 2011 ) , thus becoming part of the Western tradition 's spiritual pietas ( or Catholic devotions ) , as follows : Refoule , 1967 These "evil thoughts " can be collected into three groups : In AD 590 , a little over two centuries after Evagrius wrote his list , Pope Gregory I revised this list to form the more common Seven Deadly Sins , by folding sorrow/despair into acedia , vainglory into pride , and adding envy . 
27	Introduction to Paulist Press edition of by Kallistos Ware , p63 . 
28	In the order used by both Pope Gregory and by Dante Alighieri in his epic poem The Divine Comedy , the seven deadly sins are as follows : The identification and definition of the seven deadly sins over their history has been a fluid process and the idea of what each of the seven actually encompasses has evolved over time . 
29	Additionally , as a result of semantic change : It is this revised list that Dante uses . 
30	The process of semantic change has been aided by the fact that the personality traits are not collectively referred to , in either a cohesive or codified manner , by the Bible itself ; other literary and ecclesiastical works were instead consulted , as sources from which definitions might be drawn . 
31	February 2011 Part II of Dante 's Divine Comedy , Purgatorio , has almost certainly been the best known source since the Renaissance . 
32	February 2011 The modern Roman Catholic Catechism lists the sins in Latin as " superbia , avaritia , invidia , ira , luxuria , gula , pigritia seu acedia " , with an English translation of " pride , avarice , envy , wrath , lust , gluttony , and sloth/acedia " .

47	2010-07-24 Each of the seven deadly sins now also has an opposite among corresponding seven holy virtues ( sometimes also referred to as the contrary virtues ) . 
48	In parallel order to the sins they oppose , the seven holy virtues are humility , charity , kindness , patience , chastity , temperance , and diligence . 
49	Lust Lust or lechery ( carnal " luxuria " ) is usually thought of as excessive thoughts or desires of a sexual nature . 
50	In Dante 's Purgatorio , the penitent walks within flames to purge himself of lustful/sexual thoughts and feelings . 
51	In Dante 's Inferno , unforgiven souls of the sin of lust are blown about in restless hurricane-like winds symbolic of their own lack of self control to their lustful passions in earthly life . 
52	Gluttony thumb"Excess "( Albert Anker _ 1896 ) Derived from the Latin gluttire , meaning to gulp down or swallow , gluttony ( Latin , la gula ) is the over-indulgence and over-consumption of anything to the point of waste . 
53	In the Christian religions , it is considered a sin because of the excessive desire for food or its withholding from the needy .

59	Depending on the culture , it can be seen as either a vice or a sign of status . 
60	Where food is relatively scarce , being able to eat well might be something to take pride in . 
61	But in an area where food is routinely plentiful , it may be considered a sign of self-control to resist the temptation to over-indulge . 
62	Medieval church leaders ( e .g 
63	. 
64	, Thomas Aquinas ) took a more expansive view of gluttony , arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals , and the constant eating of delicacies and excessively costly foods .

71	Gluttony Catholic Encyclopedia Aquinas went so far as to prepare a list of six ways to commit gluttony , including : Greed uprightleftthumb1909 painting '' The Worship ofMammon '' byEvelyn De Morgan . 
72	Greed ( Latin , la avaritia ) , also known as avarice or covetousness , is , like lust and gluttony , a sin of excess . 
73	However , greed ( as seen by the church ) is applied to a very excessive or rapacious desire and pursuit of wealth , status , and power . 
74	St . 
75	Thomas Aquinas wrote that greed was " a sin against God , just as all mortal sins , in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things . 
76	" In Dante 's Purgatory , the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated too much on earthly thoughts . 
77	" Avarice " is more of a blanket term that can describe many other examples of greedy behavior . 
78	These include disloyalty , deliberate betrayal , or treason , April 2008 especially for personal gain , for example through bribery . 
79	Scavenging October 2008 and hoard of materials or objects , theft and robbery , especially by means of violence , trickery , or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed . 
80	Such misdeeds can include simony , where one attempts to purchase or sell sacraments , including Holy Orders and , therefore , positions of authority in the Church hierarchy . 
81	As defined outside of Christian writings , greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs , especially with respect to material wealth .

86	The Free Dictionary The Free Dictionary 1987-04-01 2010-07-24 Sloth ( deadly sin ) Over time , the "acedia " in Pope Gregory 's order has come to be closer in meaning to sloth ( Latin , la Socordia ) . 
87	The focus came to be on the consequences of acedia rather than the cause , and so , by the 17th century , the exact deadly sin referred to was believed to be the failure to utilize one 's talents and gifts . 
88	May 2009 Even in Dante 's time there were signs of this change ; in his Purgatorio he had portrayed the penance for acedia as running continuously at top speed . 
89	The modern view goes further , regarding laziness and indifference as the sin at the heart of the matter . 
90	Since this contrasts with a more willful failure to , for example , love God and his works , sloth is often seen as being considerably less serious than the other sins , more a sin of omission than of commission . 
91	Acedia Acedia ( Latin , la acedia ) ( from Greek ακηδία ) is the neglect to take care of something that one should do . 
92	It is translated to apathetic listlessness ; depression without joy . 
93	It is similar to melancholy , although acedia describes the behaviour , while melancholy suggests the emotion producing it . 
94	In early Christian thought , the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God and the world God created ; by contrast , apathy was considered a refusal to help others in time of need . 
95	When Thomas Aquinas described acedia in his interpretation of the list , he described it as an uneasiness of the mind , being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability . 
96	Dante refined this definition further , describing acedia as the failure to love God with all one 's heart , all one 's mind and all one 's soul ; to him it was the middle sin , the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love . 
97	Some scholars July 2011 have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide . 
98	Wrath Wrath ( Latin , la ira ) , also known as " rage " , may be described as inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger . 
99	Wrath , in its purest form , presents with self-destructiveness , violence , and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries . 
100	Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead . 
101	Feelings of anger can manifest in different ways , including impatience , revenge , and vigilantism . 
102	Wrath is the only sin not necessarily associated with selfishness or self-interest ( although one can of course be wrathful for selfish reasons , such as jealousy , ( closely related to the sin of envy ) . 
103	Dante described vengeance as "love of justice perverted to revenge and spite " . 
104	In its original form , the sin of anger also encompassed anger pointed internally rather than externally . 
105	Thus suicide was deemed as the ultimate , albeit tragic , expression of hatred directed inwardly , a final rejection of God 's gifts . 
106	October 2011 Envy Like greed , Envy ( Latin , la invidia ) may be characterized by an insatiable desire ; they differ , however , for two main reasons : Dante defined this as " a desire to deprive other men of theirs . 
107	" Envy can be directly related to the Ten Commandments , specifically " Neither shall you desire ... 
108	anything that belongs to your neighbour" . 
109	In Dante 's Purgatory , the punishment for the envious is to have their eyes sewn shut with wire because they have gained sinful pleasure from seeing others brought low . 
110	Aquinas described envy as " sorrow for another 's good " .

119	2010-01-02 Pride thumbright240pxBuilding theTower of Babelwas _ forDante_ an example ofpride . 
120	Painting byPieter Brueghel the Elder In almost every list , pride ( Latin , la superbia ) , or hubris , is considered the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins , and the source of the others . 
121	It is identified as a desire to be more important or attractive than others , failing to acknowledge the good work of others , and excessive love of self (especially holding self out of proper position toward God ) . 
122	Dante 's definition was "love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one 's neighbour . 
123	" In Jacob Bidermann 's medieval miracle play , Cenodoxus , pride is the deadliest of all the sins and leads directly to the damnation of the titulary famed Parisian doctor . 
124	In perhaps the best-known example , the story of Lucifer , pride ( his desire to compete with God ) was what caused his fall from Heaven , and his resultant transformation into Satan . 
125	In Dante 's Divine Comedy , the penitents were forced to walk with stone slabs bearing down on their backs to induce feelings of humility . 
126	Vanity Vainglory ( Latin , la vanagloria ) is unjustified boasting . 
127	Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride , so he folded vainglory into pride for his listing of sins . 
128	September 2011 The Latin term gloria roughly means boasting , although its English cognate - glory - has come to have an exclusively positive meaning ; historically , vain roughly meant futile , but by the 14th century had come to have the strong narcissistic undertones , of irrelevant accuracy , that it retains today . 
129	Oxford English dictionary As a result of these semantic changes , vainglory has become a rarely used word in itself , and is now commonly interpreted as referring to vanity ( in its modern narcissistic sense ) . 
130	The Roman Catholic Church also recognizes seven virtues , which correspond inversely to each of the seven deadly sins . 
131	In 1589 , Peter Binsfeld paired each of the deadly sins with a demon , who tempted people by means of the associated sin . 
132	According to Binsfeld 's classification of demons , the pairings are as follows This contrasts slightly with an earlier series of pairings found in the fifteenth century English Lollard tract Lanterne of Light , which pairs Lucifer with Pride , Beelzebub with Envy , Satan / Amon with Wrath , Abadon with Sloth , Mammon with Avarice , Belphegor with Gluttony and Asmodeus with Lust .

146	2009-02-20 2010-07-24 The seven deadly sins have long been a source of inspiration for writers and artists , from morality tale of the Middle Ages to modern manga series and video games . 
147	In his 1973 book , Whatever Became of Sin ? , Karl Menninger argued that the traditional list of the seven deadly sins was incomplete ; that most modern ethicists would include cruelty and dishonesty and probably would rate these as more serious than some of the more traditional sins such as gluttony or sadness . 
148	In his 1908 book , " How one is not to be , " Andrew Culbertson argues that two further vices should be added to the deadly sins : fear and superstition . 
149	Fear , in Culbertson 's description , amounts to the modern psychiatric condition called Delusional disorder , while superstition is , " Belief in things that one does not understand , to the point of giving money to frauds and spiritual confidence men . 
150	" The Enneagram of Personality integrates the seven with two additional " sins " , deceit and fear . 
151	The Enneagram descriptions are broader than the traditional Christian interpretation and are presented in a comprehensive map .

199	The punishment for the latter two sins takes place in the Stygian lake , the wrathful being punished atop the lake , attacking one another with the various members of their person , including fangs , while the slothful are punished underneath the lake , breathing sighs in bubbles and singing a dolorous song .
